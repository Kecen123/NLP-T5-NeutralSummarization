TITLE=> Supreme Court to Open New Term While Confirmation Hearings Continue. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court will open a new term via teleconference Monday with one open seat, and the U.S. Senate moves forward on confirmation hearings despite two Republicans on the Judiciary Committee testing positive for coronavirus this week. On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said high court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearings will continue on Oct. 12. Barrett, who was with the president last Saturday during her nomination, tested negative this week, after recovering from the virus earlier this summer. This term, the Supreme Court will likely hear arguments to overturn Obama-era healthcare, address mail-in voting policies and hear arguments over whether Congress can access files from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum tended to analyze the issues likely to face the court in the upcoming term. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight Barrett's negative COVID-19 test and her likelihood of being confirmed before the election.
TITLE=> Trump’s ‘Proud Boys, Stand Back, Stand by’ Comment at Debate Spurs Controversy. ARTICLE=> During Tuesday’s presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace asked President Donald Trump if he was willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and “to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence” in cities like Portland. Trump replied: “Sure, I’m prepared to do it, but I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right-wing. I’m willing to do anything, I want to see peace.” Pressed by Wallace and former Vice President Joe Biden to “do it,” Trump said: ”Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left.” The Proud Boys, a self-described “western chauvinist” group, reportedly celebrated Trump’s comments; Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio denied they are white supremacists. Outlets on all sides featured coverage of reactions from politicians and other public figures, many speculating on what Trump meant in saying "stand by." Coverage in some left- and center- rated outlets focused on criticisms from Twitter. Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on requests for Trump to clarify his comments.

ARTICLE=> Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and President Donald Trump's respective 2020 presidential campaigns both announced record-breaking fundraising totals for the final quarter of 2019 on Thursday. Sanders' campaign reportedly raised $34 million in the year's final three months, the highest quarterly total of any Democratic candidate; Trump's campaign reportedly raised over $46 million to break its previous $41 million-record. Left-rated outlets tended to focus coverage on Democratic fundraising totals, while right-rated outlets focused more on Trump's fundraising.
TITLE=> CDC Says Delta Variant May Cause Mild but Contagious COVID-19 in Vaccinated People. ARTICLE=> Data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that vaccinated people, if infected with a "breakthrough" case of the COVID-19 Delta variant, may transmit it just as easily unvaccinated people. The report says 74% of 469 COVID-19 cases connected to large gatherings held in Barnstable County, Mass., around the July 4 holiday were among fully vaccinated people. Breakthrough COVID-19 cases are rare and typically mild or asymptomatic. According to the CDC, the data served as evidence for its return to recommending that vaccinated people wear masks when indoors in high-transmission regions. 	The news made headlines across the spectrum Friday. Some right-rated sources framed the announcement as overdue; many right-rated voices have said the CDC's new masking guidance lacks evidence. Many left-rated media focused more on an internal CDC document obtained by the Washington Post (Lean Left bias) in which the agency says Delta is as contagious as chickenpox and potentially more dangerous than other variants, and stresses that "the war" against COVID-19 "has changed."

TITLE=> 'Howdy Modi' Event Draws President Trump. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump made an appearance at a Texas event hosted by Indian Americans welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday. Trump took the opportunity to show off his strong relationship with PM Modi, speaking about U.S.-India trade relationships, the strength of their democracies, and fighting "radical Islamic terror," an issue important to right-leaning voters in both countries. Both leaders are set to attend the U.N General Assembly in New York on Monday. Left-leaning media has reported critically on the seemingly nationalistic ideals of both leaders; right-leaning media have reported positively on Trump's affirmations of religious freedom and democracy.
TITLE=> House Democrats Unveil New Rules Package. ARTICLE=> House Democrats have unveiled new rules for the next two years in Congress, including the creation of a climate change committee and a provision that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Some Democrats have vowed to oppose the package because of the pay-go portion, which requires that new expenditures be offset by spending cuts or increased sources of revenue.
TITLE=> Perspectives: President Joe Biden's Falling Poll Numbers. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden's approval ratings are falling, according to several national polls conducted over the past week.  The FiveThirtyEight polling average says an aggregate of 49.2% of voters disapprove of Biden's presidency, while 44.5% approve.  Polls suggest that support for Biden has declined in particular among key Democratic constituencies, including Latinos, black people, women and young people; some also suggest the drop is due to the disorderly U.S. exit from Afghanistan and from the rise of the COVID-19 delta variant. 	Media from the right, left and center shared perspectives on the decline in Biden's approval rating, with many suggesting that despite the fact that attention on Afghanistan is fading and COVID-19 cases are falling, Biden's approval ratings haven't recovered.
TITLE=> 'Operation Warp Speed': Trump Promises Coronavirus Vaccine By End of Year. ARTICLE=> On the last night of the Republican National Convention (RNC), President Donald Trump promised a “safe and effective” coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year in his nomination acceptance speech. Trump highlighted his administration’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a public-private partnership, saying the project had "three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now." Some fact checkers report that Trump cannot guarantee that the project will develop a successful vaccine by the end of the year. Of the four vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States, the one from Moderna is furthest along; the U.S. also recently approved the use of convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19, but currently there’s no clear proof the plasma treatment saves lives. Coverage from several left- and center-rated outlets suggested Trump's "framing" of the coronavirus was "rosier" than reality suggests, highlighting the challenges that the virus presents. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on Trump's history in dealing with the virus and the details of his speech.
TITLE=> AG Barr Says DOJ Hasn't Found Evidence of Decisive Voter Fraud. ARTICLE=> In an interview with the Associated Press published Tuesday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the Department of Justice (DOJ) has "not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome" in the 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump's campaign released a statement in response, saying "there hasn’t been any semblance" of a DOJ probe into election manipulation. Barr authorized a DOJ investigation of potential election irregularities on Nov. 9; his recent comments come as Arizona and Wisconsin have officially certified their election results for projected winner Joe Biden. Barr's statement made headlines on both sides of the spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on the notion that claims of decisive voter fraud are entirely unsupported. Some reports from right-rated sources concentrated on the Trump campaign's rebuttal.
TITLE=> Missiles Strike Base in Syria. ARTICLE=> Russia and the Syrian military blamed Israel for a pre-dawn missile attack Monday on a major air base in central Syria, and the U.S. has confirmed that it was Israel. The airstrikes killed 14 people, including Iranians active in Syria.

ARTICLE=> Dozens of websites in the U.S. and Europe were unavailable Tuesday morning, including the U.K. government’s main public-services portal and several major U.S. and European news outlets, such as the New York Times, CNN and Le Monde. The issue is reportedly tied to a glitch with cloud computing services provider Fastly, which said a fix has been applied.
TITLE=> First Person Charged With Felony In Capitol Breach Case Gets Prison Sentence. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Florida resident Paul Hodgkins, 38, became the first person charged with a felony in the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. Last month, Hodgkins pled guilty to obstructing congressional proceedings after he waved a Trump flag and took pictures in the Senate chamber for 15 minutes on Jan. 6. Hodgkins apologized to the court, saying he got caught up in the moment and that it "was a foolish decision." While Hodgkins asked the judge for no prison time, the Justice Department requested a 1.5-year prison term. Hodgkins was sentenced to eight months in prison and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine for causing damage to the building. District Judge Randolph Moss said he would allow Hodgkins some leniency since he was not involved in a violent crime, pled guilty early and gave a "sincere" apology to the court. The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Some outlets from across the spectrum remarked that the judge's decision could set a precedent for the rest of the Jan. 6 cases.

ARTICLE=> Projected 2020 presidential winner Joe Biden announced nine new senior White House staff appointments Tuesday despite the fact that President Donald Trump continues to contest election results. Biden's campaign page states a commitment to building an "administration that looks like America"; his staff picks so far include five women and four people of color, many of them drawn from his own campaign advisers and aides. Other notable appointments include Ron Klain as Chief of Staff, former campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon as his deputy chief of staff, and campaign co-chair and Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond as the lead of White House Office of Public Engagement. Coverage from across the political spectrum analyzed each appointment and their history; reports from left-rated sources tended to emphasize the diversity within Biden's staff picks.
TITLE=> Celebrating an Easter Sunday Marked by Pandemic. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has given Easter Sunday 2020 a much different look than usual, moving church services and family gatherings online as social distancing continues to be the norm. Many voices have focused on the added importance of camaraderie and compassion during a crisis; some outlets are offering ways to watch live video of Easter services online.
TITLE=> McConnell Says $2,000 Checks Have "No Realistic Path" to Quick Senate Passage. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that proposed $2,000 stimulus checks have "no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate." He then introduced his own proposal, which would include the $2,000 checks but also repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and set up a committee to study election integrity. His comments cast doubt on the possibility of more valuable checks, which were recently suggested by President Donald Trump and pushed by Congressional Democrats. A round of $600 stimulus payments began Tuesday as part of the recently-passed $900 billion coronavirus relief package. Coverage from right-rated sources focused more on McConnell's reasons for rejecting the proposal, which include the notion that the larger checks actually benefit high-earning individuals disproportionately. Reports from left-rated outlets concentrated on the ongoing disagreement between Trump and McConnell, sometimes framing it as unnecessary political theater that delays much-needed virus relief for millions of people.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Police Reform Negotiations Collapse. ARTICLE=> Lawmakers have failed to strike a bipartisan police reform deal after months of negotiations in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others. In a statement Wednesday, President Joe Biden said he still hopes to pass a "comprehensive and meaningful police reform bill" and chastised Republicans for purportedly rejecting "modest reforms, which even the previous president had supported." Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a lead negotiator, said his Democratic "negotiating partners walked away from the table." A key point of disagreement was on reforming qualified immunity, which protects individual police officers from civil liability for misconduct. Democrats and Republicans seemed aligned on other details, including banning chokeholds, boosting funds for mental health resources and cutting off the transfer of military equipment to police. The future of bipartisan police reform legislation is now unclear. Left-rated sources often framed Republican stubbornness as the reason for the talks failing; some highlighted how Democrats still plan to try to advance police reform legislation. Reports from right-rated outlets often painted Democrats as to blame for the failed negotiations, with some accusing them of an unwillingness to compromise. Others framed the "Defund the Police" movement as having hurt efforts to pass bipartisan legislation.
TITLE=> Jobless Claims Drop to 712,000. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to a still-high 712,000, a sign that the U.S. economy remains under pressure from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and business shutdowns. The latest claims figures show gradual improvement and are below economists' projections for 775,000 claims this week, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
TITLE=> From Schools to Gyms to Family Parties, Public Safety Debates Persist. ARTICLE=> Americans eager to find a safe way to return to normal life are debating which sectors, industries, businesses and public areas should open first, which should maintain heavy restrictions, and which present the highest risk. Debates about public safety aren't just centered on "public" spaces; many Americans are conflicted within their own households about living safely and practicing healthy habits as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues. Right-rated voices are generally expressing more optimism about the probability of safe and timely re-openings.
TITLE=> Georgia Governor, State Legislature Passes State Election Overhaul. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law a state election overhaul shortly after a Republican-majority state legislature approved it. The overhaul includes new restrictions on absentee voting, expanded access to in-person early voting, and gives the legislature greater control over how elections are run after a months-long debate over election laws in the battleground state. The 96-page bill alters Georgia's absentee voting rules by adding new identification requirements, requiring voters to submit ID information with both an absentee ballot request and the ballot itself. It also limits the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, allows unlimited challenges to a voter’s qualifications, shortens the runoff election period from nine to four weeks, and shortens the amount of time voters have to request an absentee ballot. The bill also gives the Republican-controlled state legislature the power to appoint a majority of members on the five-person state election board. This comes after the state saw record turnout in the November election and January US Senate runoffs, and received a record 1.3 million absentee ballots. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame the overhaul as "passing voting restrictions," and highlighted Democratic lawmakers who opposed the bill, saying the bill would make it harder to vote, especially for marginalized groups. Some right-rated outlets highlighted Republicans, including Kemp, who defended the bill, claiming it expands voter access in Georgia. Kemp also claimed it protects the election process from "rhetoric from those that are fund-raising off of this issue and polarizing it."
TITLE=> Joe Biden Sworn in as 46th US President. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States Wednesday in Washington D.C shortly before noon ET.

Many reports also concentrated on the executive actions Biden is expected to sign soon, and on Harris being the first woman elected as vice president.
TITLE=> Federal Judge Orders Trump Administration to Restore DACA. ARTICLE=> On Friday, a New York federal judge ordered the Trump administration to begin accepting new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era initiative that provides semi-legal status to those who entered the U.S. illegally as children. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security to announce by Monday that it is resuming the approval of new DACA applications and work permits, and to return to its previous practice of granting and extending DACA status for two years at a time. This comes after the Trump administration announced it would reject new DACA applications, but let current DACA recipients continue to renew their protections. Projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden is expected to fully restore DACA . The story was covered by outlets across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets speculated about the likelihood of the order to open the window for new DACA applications for the first time since 2017.
TITLE=> Paul Manafort Sent to Jail, Pending Trial. ARTICLE=> Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's bail was revoked by a Washington D.C. judge Friday. He was sent to jail in the wake of witness tampering charges lodged by special counsel Robert Mueller.
TITLE=> Rush Limbaugh Dead at 70. ARTICLE=> Rush Limbaugh, the controversial conservative talk radio host, died Wednesday at the age of 70. Limbaugh was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer in January 2020, and he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Donald Trump in April 2020. His death was announced by his wife on “The Rush Limbaugh Show,” the AM radio show Limbaugh started in 1988. Coverage of Limbaugh’s death varied widely across the spectrum, describing him as “influential,” “controversial” and “a pillar of right-wing media.” Coverage in right-rated outlets was generally positive, describing him and his career as “legendary” and “iconic,” and focusing on how he changed the political media landscape by giving social conservatives a prominent media voice. Coverage in left-rated outlets was generally critical of Limbaugh, often focusing on criticisms of his purportedly partisan attacks, characterizing him as malicious or divisive, and describing some of his remarks as “sexist, homophobic and racist." Some coverage from left-rated sources also focused on his relationship with Trump and his role in Trump's 2016 election victory.
TITLE=> Economy Added 136,000 Jobs in September. ARTICLE=> The 136,000 jobs added by the U.S. economy in September missed expectations, according to multiple reports. At 3.5 percent, unemployment is at its lowest rate since 1969. Most reporting outlets, regardless of political leaning, focused on the slower-than-expected growth while noting the positive trend in unemployment.
TITLE=> December 2019 Jobs Report. ARTICLE=> According to the Labor Department's December jobs report, the unemployment rate remained at 3.5%, with an additional 145,000 jobs added. This fell just below expectations, with most Dow Jones experts who were surveyed predicting 160,000 additional jobs. After the report's release, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) crossed the 29,000-point threshold for the first time ever. Many outlets, irrespective of leaning, focused on the connection between the labor report and the DJIA's record volume. Some reporting and analysis around the report focused on the decline in wages, steady government bond prices, and women overtaking men as the workforce's majority.

TITLE=> School Reopening Guidelines Fuel Public Health Debate. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance for reopening schools last week amid the COVID-19 pandemic, laying out essential features of safe reopening including mask-wearing, social distancing and more testing. Some experts praised the guidance; others say it won't do enough to fully open schools. The Biden administration has at times been inconsistent on its goals for reopening schools. On Tuesday, Biden said his 100-day goal was to have most elementary schools open five days a week; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said last week that schools would be considered open if they held in-person classes at least one day per week. Some voices on all sides are calling for schools to reopen, focusing on potential psychological consequences for children who aren't learning in-person. There's disagreement on the left about reopening schools; some are siding with scientists who say it's safe, and some are aligning with the many teachers unions that are reluctant to send teachers back before vaccines are more widely administered. Many right-rated voices have been critical of teachers unions and of the Biden administration's messaging about reopening.
TITLE=> Bernie Sanders Staffers Allege 'Sexual Violence and Harassment' During 2016 Campaign. ARTICLE=> Several staffers from Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential run allege that almost a dozen female aides were sexually harassed while working on the campaign and that their complaints were mishandled by superiors.

TITLE=> Off-Year State Elections Prompt 2020 Speculation.

TITLE=> Biden, Trump Respond to Killing In Portland. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden condemned violence in Portland, Oregon on Sunday, after one person was killed during a clash between opposing groups. The victim has been identified as Jay Bishop, an alleged supporter of right-wing group "Patriot Prayer." People have been in downtown Portland showing support for Black Lives Matter nearly every night for three months since the killing of George Floyd. On Saturday, Trump supporters rallied in the suburbs of Portland; according to Portland Police, some of them migrated downtown after the rally, where they clashed with the other group. “I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right," Biden said in a statement, before challenging President Donald Trump to do the same. “We must not become a country at war with ourselves,” Biden said. On Sunday morning, Trump called for "law and order," saying that the only way to stop violence in "Democrat-run cities" is through strength. Trump then went onto criticize Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for his handling of the protests. Wheeler responded by criticizing the president for "divisive" language and reiterated his condemnation of violence and support of police. The killing was widely covered by outlets on all sides of the political spectrum. Coverage from the left tended to focus on Biden's condemnation of the violence; some left-rated voices also criticized Trump's "law and order" approach. Some voices from the right tended to highlight the shooting victim's right-wing beliefs as evidence of Antifa and other left-wing groups' intolerance.
TITLE=> Pentagon Says Troops Must Get Vaccinated 'Immediately'. ARTICLE=> The Pentagon is ordering all U.S. military personnel to get vaccinated against COVID-19 immediately. In a memo dated Aug. 24, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin directed military department heads "to immediately begin full vaccination" of any unvaccinated troops. Austin made the call following "careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President." The announcement also follows the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; unvaccinated troops will be required to receive Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine, which is the only COVID-19 vaccine with full FDA approval. Austin's memo did not impose a hard deadline or outline specific consequences for those who don't follow the order. A Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday that roughly 68% of all military personnel are fully vaccinated; the numbers vary by department, with 40% of the Army fully vaccinated compared to 73% of the Navy. 	The news was covered across the spectrum Wednesday. Some coverage from right-rated sources highlighted a proposal from 31 House Republicans that would have prohibited the military vaccine mandate.
TITLE=> Roy Moore Announces Senate Campaign; Met With Backlash. ARTICLE=> Roy Moore, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama, announced his candidacy for Senate, on Thursday. Moore was infamously accused of sexual misconduct during his 2017 run for Senate. He ran to replace the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions, who went on to become the Attorney General of the United States. Moore, a republican, lost to democrat Doug Jones, the first democrat to win an Alabama Senate seat in 25 years. Moore had the backing of President Trump during that 2017 campaign, but does not have that same support this time around. In fact, politicians and voters from his own side of the aisle have rebuked Moore's candidacy; Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) condemned the run by saying "we'll be opposing Roy Moore vigorously." Freshman Senator Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) condemned Moore's candidacy by saying "Give me a break. This place has enough creepy old men." Moore is the fourth republican candidate to announce a campaign for Jones' Senate seat, with a fifth expected to announce at a later time.
TITLE=> In Controversial Editorial, Christianity Today Endorses Trump Impeachment. ARTICLE=> Christianity Today, one of the largest evangelical Christian publications in the country, endorsed the impeachment of President Donald Trump on Thursday. In a controversial editorial written by retiring Editor-in-Chief Mark Galli, the magazine called the Republican "profoundly immoral" and urged its religious readers to "remember who you are and whom you serve." Outlets on both sides of the aisle underscored how remarkable the editorial was, considering its source and the fact that Trump won 81 percent of the evangelical vote in his 2016 election. Still, others pointed out that the magazine also supported the impeachment of former Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998. Trump himself, in a lengthy Tweet on Friday, slammed the publication as a "far left magazine" (Allsides gives it a rating of lean right).
TITLE=> Biden Flip-Flops On Complying With Senate Impeachment Subpoena. ARTICLE=> Former Vice President and Democratic presidential primary front-runner Joe Biden has backtracked on comments that he would not comply with a Republican subpoena should members seek his testimony in an upcoming Senate impeachment trial. After telling the Des Moines Register on Friday that he would refuse to cooperate with the order, Biden said yesterday that he would obey any subpoena sent to him, but maintained that he doesn't believe there is "any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial." Outlets on both sides of the aisle noted the contradictions in the candidate's statements and how quickly he sought to reverse course on the issue. Some pointed out that the White House had also refused to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry.
TITLE=> State Department Blocks Ambassador Gordon Sondland From Testifying In House Impeachment Deposition. ARTICLE=> The State Department has blocked Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, from testifying at a scheduled deposition on the Ukraine controversy.

TITLE=> Death of Jeffrey Epstein in New York Jail Raises Questions. ARTICLE=> Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who was being held in a federal jail in downtown Manhattan on sex trafficking charges, was found dead on Saturday morning. Reports stated Epstein committed suicide, yet many commentators and media outlets questioned whether or not foul play was at work due to Epstein's connections to high-profile politicians, celebrities, and royalty. Commentators on both sides questioned how a high-profile inmate was taken off suicide watch at the end of last month and left unmonitored. On Saturday, the Department of Justice announced it will investigate Epstein's death.

TITLE=> First Biden Press Conference Set for March 25. ARTICLE=> White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that President Joe Biden will hold a press conference on Mar. 25, his first since taking office. Biden has waited longer than any president in the last 100 years to hold a formal question-and-answer press conference with the media. The delay has prompted some scrutiny throughout the political world, especially from conservatives and media critics. The announcement was covered across the spectrum. Reports from many right-rated outlets and some center-rated sources mentioned Biden's history of verbal stumbles and painted the announcement as overdue, sometimes using words like "finally" in headlines. Voices on all sides, particularly the right, have repeatedly questioned why Biden has yet to hold a formal press conference. Coverage from many right-rated outlets has framed Biden's lack of public Q&As as indicative of his administration's efforts to protect him from press scrutiny.
TITLE=> UN Issues Report on Human-Caused Climate Change. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report on the dangers of human-caused climate change, saying the Earth will cross a critical temperature threshold as early as 2030. The report, prepared by hundreds of scientists, says climate change is intensifying worldwide due to human influence that "has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land"; it also calls climate change a "code red for humanity," and references continued sea-level rise and extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is cited as the main driver of climate change, while air pollutants and other greenhouse gases are highlighted as contributing factors. 	The report was a top story on many left- and center-rated news websites Monday morning. It was covered less prominently by right-rated sources.
TITLE=> Mississippi Asks Supreme Court to Uphold 15-Week Abortion Ban, Overturn Roe v. Wade. ARTICLE=> Mississippi's attorney general urged the Supreme Court Thursday to uphold a 2018 state law that prohibits most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy — a law in conflict with Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion at the federal level. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch (R) said in a merits brief that Roe v. Wade and 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey are "egregiously wrong," and that state legislatures should have more authority to decide their own abortion laws. The filing is the first time the state has included an attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade in its argument. In May, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case during its next session, which begins in October.  The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum, with most reports offering speculation about the case's outcome.

TITLE=> Analysis From Day Two of Public Impeachment Hearings. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House Intelligence Committee concluded its second day of public impeachment hearings on Friday, with former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testifying about her work in Ukraine and ultimate removal from the post. Yovanovitch reiterated much of what she had reported in her closed-door deposition with lawmakers the month before, but the hearing also provoked a harshly critical tweet from President Donald Trump, which some Democrats and media outlets on the left condemned as a form of witness intimidation. Yovanovitch is the third U.S. official to publicly testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Former Ambassador William Taylor and George Kent, the State Department's top official on Ukraine policy, appeared in front of the committee on Tuesday.

Ronny Jackson found that Jackson disparaged colleagues, improperly used sleeping pills and repeatedly drank on duty during his time as White House physician. Jackson served on the White House medical team from 2006-2019, and is currently a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas. The Pentagon report, launched in 2018, examines allegations against Jackson going as far back as 2012. The review found that Jackson made "sexual and denigrating" comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy for drinking alcohol while on a presidential trip, and took prescription-strength sleeping medication. Former President Donald Trump nominated Jackson to be his Veterans Affairs secretary in 2018, but Jackson withdrew after allegations that he created a hostile work environment and drank on the job. On Tuesday Jackson denied the report, saying that it was "politically motivated" and that the inspector general "resurrected" old allegations against him because he refused to denounce Trump. Outlets across the political spectrum covered the Pentagon report and Jackson's denial of the allegations. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets detailed the claims against Jackson; some right-rated outlets highlighted claims that the report failed to substantiate.
TITLE=> Perspectives on Rush Limbaugh Receiving Medal of Freedom. ARTICLE=> Media coverage was split politically after President Donald Trump awarded conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Medal of Freedom at the State of the Union Address on February 4. Some left-rated voices argued his 'tirades' should disqualify him from receiving the medal, while right-rated outlets generally concentrated more on his influence on conservatism and radio. Limbaugh recently announced that he was diagnosed with terminal cancer; the medal is the highest civilian honor in the U.S.
TITLE=> CDC Panel Recommends Resuming Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Distribution. ARTICLE=> A panel of experts advising the CDC voted Friday to recommend resuming distribution of Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot coronavirus vaccine, so long as the vaccine’s Emergency Use Authorization included a warning about “rare but clinically serious” blood clots. The vote comes 10 days after the CDC and FDA paused distribution “out of an abundance of caution” following 6 reports of severe blood clots out of over 7 million vaccine recipients. As of Friday, a total of 15 cases of clots had been reported, all of them in women, suggesting a rate of 7 per 1 million vaccinated among women ages 18 to 49. Outlets from across the spectrum covered this story, featured it prominently on homepages, and portrayed facts about the panel's decision in a mostly balanced manner.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Senate Report on January 6 Finds Intelligence, Security Failures. ARTICLE=> A bipartisan group of senators released a report Tuesday detailing the “security, planning and response failures” surrounding the January 6th Capitol riot. The report, compiled jointly by two Senate committees, found that Capitol Police’s intelligence component had prior evidence of the potential for violence but failed to fully share that information with Capitol police officers and their partners. The evidence included comments on a pro-Trump website that detailed the Capitol’s tunnel system and said “This is do or die. Bring your guns.” The senators also recommended giving the Capitol Police chief the authority to directly request National Guard support. The report did not investigate the root causes of the attack, which would have been a focus of the proposed January 6th Commission recently blocked by Senate Republicans.  Coverage was more prominently featured in left- and center-rated outlets. Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on different findings of the report, including that the Defense Department’s response was “informed by criticism” of its response to the George Floyd protests.

According to the White House, the vice president and Second Lady Karen Pence, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams, will receive the vaccine on Friday to "build confidence among the American people.” CNN reported that Biden, who said he would follow the recommendations of Dr. Anthony Fauci, may take the vaccine next week. "When I do it, I'll do it publicly, so you can all witness my getting it done," Biden told reporters Wednesday. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have also expressed their willingness to publicly receive a vaccine. President Donald Trump, according to a CNN report, won't get the vaccine until its recommended by the White House medical team. This comes after the Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine for emergency use authorization last week. The story was covered by media outlets across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> What Coronavirus Means for the 2020 Census. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic will undoubtedly affect the 2020 U.S. Census, the 24th in the country's history.

ARTICLE=> Second lady Karen Pence has accepted a part-time position as an art teacher at a private Christian school in Springfield, Va.

TITLE=> Portland Protests, Violence Continue in Parallel. ARTICLE=> A man was reportedly brought to the hospital with serious injuries late Sunday after he was allegedly dragged from his truck and beaten by a crowd in Portland, Oregon. The alleged assault, which was captured on video, happened as both peaceful demonstrations and violent riots ensue in and around the city following George Floyd's death in police custody in May. Elsewhere Sunday, the mother of a man fatally shot by police in 2018 led a crowd of demonstrators in protesting outside the Multnomah County Justice Center in the city's downtown neighborhood. The apparent beating was a focus of right-rated coverage throughout Monday, with less reporting coming from left- and center-rated sources. Many reports from right-rated sources characterized the alleged attackers as "Antifa" or "Black Lives Matter"; some reports for left- and center-rated sources described the accused assailants as "protesters". Other coverage, particularly from right- and center-rated outlets, focused on the Portland Police Bureau's report that local police dispatchers are being inundated with 911 calls. Updated 08/18/2020 at 12:07 p.m. ET
TITLE=> DeVos Announces New Rules for Campus Sexual Assault Investigations. ARTICLE=> Secretary of Education Betsy Devos announced Wednesday new rules set to take effect in August that mandate changes to procedures for private and public universities investigating sexual assault allegations on campus. The new stipulations, which are alterations to the Title IX civil rights law, include requiring cross-examinations of alleged victims and offenders and a revised definition of sexual harassment. Most left-rated reporting focused on criticisms of the rules, which opponents say give the accused an advantage while placing sexual assault survivors at greater risk. Many right-rated outlets and voices focused on the stated goals of the rules, which purportedly seek to maintain victim protections while enhancing the rights of the accused.
TITLE=> First Lawsuit Filed Against National Emergency for Border Wall. ARTICLE=> Friday evening the first lawsuit against President Trump's new emergency declaration to build his border wall was filed in federal court district in Washington, D.C.

TITLE=> Russian Hackers Suspected in Broad Attack on US Government, Businesses. ARTICLE=> Russian hackers are suspected in a months-long cyberattack on U.S. government institutions. The Treasury and Commerce Departments, the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Institutes of Health all reportedly suffered breaches, as did various businesses and corporations. Hackers maliciously manipulated technology from software provider SolarWinds Inc. to gain access to computer systems, according to a public Securities and Exchange Commission filing from the company. The story received more prominent coverage from left- and center-rated outlets than from right-rated outlets. Reports focused on the details of U.S. investigations into the hack, potential consequences for U.S. companies and government agencies, and supply chain issues that may have enabled the hack.
TITLE=> Megyn Kelly vs. Newt Gingrich. ARTICLE=> Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, and the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly got into a televised tiff on Tuesday night in which he accused her of being “fascinated with sex” for her reporting on allegations of unwanted advances and groping by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J.

TITLE=> Ghislaine Maxwell's Deposition Transcripts Unsealed. ARTICLE=> Transcripts from the 2016 deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell, alleged accomplice in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, were unsealed Thursday after an ongoing legal battle between Maxwell and Virginia Giuffre, who accused Maxwell and Epstein of sexually abusing her and other girls who were underage. The transcripts show Maxwell repeatedly denying she had any part in recruiting and grooming minors for sexual activity with Epstein and others. Giuffre alleged that some of the men she was instructed to have sex with included Prince Andrew of Britain and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. The 400 pages of transcripts, however, appear to have these and other names and sections redacted. In July, Maxwell was arrested by the FBI in New Hampshire. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum covered the story; some coverage from the right focused on details from the 400-page deposition, as well as the others who were allegedly involved. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed Maxwell's repeated denial as "combative" and evidence of her "loyalty" to Epstein.
TITLE=> Anniversary of Charlottesville White Nationalist Rally Approaches. ARTICLE=> As the one-year anniversary of the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville approaches, the D.C. community is preparing for the second "Unite the Right" gathering, with President Trump tweeting that he condemns "all types of racism and acts of violence."
TITLE=> Trudeau's Liberal Party Wins in Canada but Remains a Minority Government. ARTICLE=> Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party won in parliamentary elections but did not get the 170 seats needed to secure a majority.  The election was held two years before a deadline and was focused largely on the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau had hoped a majority would approve of his handling of the virus. Some Canadians viewed the election as unnecessary, In his two terms as Prime Minister, Trudeau has embraced immigration, endorsed carbon taxes to fight climate change, and legalized cannabis.  He also preserved a free trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico that former U.S. President Donald Trump opposed.
TITLE=> Google, Government Settle Claim That Company Silenced Workers.

TITLE=> Is Trump a Snollygoster?. ARTICLE=> Trump's shrewd and unprincipled presidential campaign breaks new ground yet again as the official GOP candidate for president of the United States of America publicly asks a foreign power to help him dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton by illegally hacking into her email servers - a violation of US law and an unprecedented invitation to a geo-political adversary to directly participate in an American election to influence its outcome. Or was it all a big joke? Those on the Left, and pretty much everyone in the current foreign policy Establishment didn't think it was funny. Those on the Right, and the media outlets that support them are calling the statement a clear case of 'sarcasm'. You decide - is Trump a snollygoster that will do or say anything to get elected, or is the 'Left Wing' media making something out of nothing?
TITLE=> Analysis From Day One Of Public Impeachment Hearings. ARTICLE=> Top U.S. Diplomats in Ukraine testified Tuesday in the first televised hearing of the impeachment inquiry.

TITLE=> Will the FBI Bombshell Matter?. ARTICLE=> The impact of the reopening by the FBI of the Clinton email probe might not be apparent until later this week. But it might impact swing states, depending on whether or not Trump stays disciplined and focused.
TITLE=> Trump Executive Order to Reform Kidney Care. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at transforming kidney care for more than 30 million Americans with kidney disease. The executive order specifically seeks to improve detection and treatment options for kidney disease; the President cited credible data that 96% of people with kidney damage or mildly reduced kidney function are unaware of their condition. The left points out the parallels this executive order seems to draw with Obamacare. The right lauds the President's efforts to reform healthcare. It is unclear as to why a seemingly non partisan issue was resolved through executive order and not by bipartisan congressional measures, such as the First Step Act.
TITLE=> Medical Examiner Reports Officer Brian Sicknick Died of Natural Causes. ARTICLE=> Washington, D.C.'s chief medical examiner officially ruled that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's death was due to natural causes. Sicknick, an officer on duty during the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, had two strokes and died the following day. Two men are accused of assaulting and pepper spraying Sicknick during the Capitol breach, but prosecutors have not connected that assault with Sicknick's death. The medical examiner, Francisco J. Diaz, told the Washington Post the autopsy found no evidence Sicknick suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, and there was no evidence of internal or external injuries. Confusion and speculation spread after Sicknick's death when the New York Times reported that Sicknick had also been beaten with a fire extinguisher on Jan. 6; the Times' article has since been updated. Some left-rated articles tended to highlight the fact that the two men who allegedly assaulted Sicknick will not likely be charged with murder. Some claim that left-rated media quickly ran with the fire extinguisher story as a cause of Sicknick's death because he was the only one they could claim he was killed by pro-Trump protesters.
TITLE=> Peter Strzok Testifies to Congress About Anti-Trump Bias. ARTICLE=> FBI agent Peter Strzok on Thursday testified in front of Congress, engaging in a series of tense exchanges about whether or not his bias against Donald Trump influenced his work on the Russia probe.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Trump's Last Negative COVID-19 Test. ARTICLE=> Since President Donald Trump announced Thursday he had tested positive for coronavirus, some have questioned when the president's last negative test was. White House physician Sean Conley said Monday he didn't know when the president's last negative coronavirus test was; some reports from the White House medical team seem to suggest that Trump received a positive coronavirus test sometime Thursday, and still attended campaign events and interviews while waiting for confirmation from a second test. The White House previously said that Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and other officials were being tested daily; however, some say Trump could have been infected for days before he received a positive test. Joe Biden said Tuesday he and Trump should not go ahead with next week's debate if Trump still has COVID-19. Coverage on all sides of the political spectrum have noted that the White House has yet to give an answer about the president's last COVID-19 test. Some left-rated voices say that it is important to know when Trump's last negative test was in order to know how many people were unknowingly exposed to the virus.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Night Three of the Democratic National Convention. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday night, Kamala Harris formally accepted her nomination for vice president at the Democratic National Convention (DNC). The night also featured speeches from Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former President Barack Obama. Democrats kept women at the front and center of the night. In their speeches, Democrats highlighted issues such as gun violence, economy and healthcare, immigration and climate change. Obama and Warren directly criticized President Donald Trump's leadership and handling of the presidency. Trump responded to Obama's criticism in a White House press conference by attacking Obama's presidency. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight and analyze each of the issues spoken about. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused on Obama's criticism of Trump, and highlighted Trump's response.
TITLE=> G-7 Leaders Commit to Donate 1 Billion Vaccine Doses to Other Countries. ARTICLE=> Leaders at the G-7 Summit committed to donate a combined 1 billion coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries, including 500 million from the U.S. and 100 million from the U.K. The news comes amid President Joe Biden’s first day attending the G-7 Summit, where he met with leaders from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and the European Union. The G-7 leaders are also expected to endorse a global 15% minimum corporate tax rate, following an agreement reached on Saturday.  As of Friday afternoon, coverage of the G-7 Summit across the spectrum focused on the vaccine commitment or the corporate tax agreement. Some coverage in right-rated outlets used critical language like "Biden meets Brits at swanky UK retreat" and "snidely joking."
TITLE=> Senate GOP Defeats Subpoena for White House Documents. ARTICLE=> An amendment proposed by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to impeachment rules was defeated by Republicans Tuesday in a 53-47 vote that reflected the Senate's sharp partisan lines. The subpoena sought documents pertaining to White House-Ukraine relations created by former NSA adviser John Bolton, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Mulvaney aide Robert Blair. The proposed amendment is expected to be the first of several. Most reporting, regardless of political leaning, focused on Senate Republicans apparent unlikeliness to favor any rules amendments until after opening arguments from both sides are heard.
TITLE=> Trump Derides Australia Trade Deal.

TITLE=> Heat Wave Hits Western US, Threatening Fires and Straining Power Grids. ARTICLE=> A record-breaking heat wave that placed tens of millions under heat advisories in the western U.S. is spreading east, raising temperatures in Iowa and Missouri on Thursday. Power grid operators in both California and Texas asked customers to conserve energy this week, echoing Texas’ power grid failures in February. The heat may also be contributing to a 21,000-acre wildfire in Montana. This comes on the back of a historic drought, which some have called “biblical” and “potentially the worst drought in 1,200 years.” The heat wave has also affected areas in Mexico and Canada, and the Middle East is experiencing its own heat wave on the other side of the planet. Meteorologists have tied the heat to climate change as well as a “heat dome” where high pressure traps in hot air. Local outlets and mainstream outlets like Fox News and CBS News were more likely to cover this story. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to connect the heat wave to climate change. 
TITLE=> Trump and Bloomberg Trade Barbs On Social Media. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and former New York mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg are trading insults on Twitter. Trump is calling Bloomberg a "loser," while Bloomberg is describing Trump as a "barking clown."
TITLE=> Tracking All of Biden's Executive Orders. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden has signed more than 20 executive orders during his first week in office. This week, Biden signed orders aimed at combatting racist and discriminatory practices and prioritizing climate change action, as outlined by incoming Chief of Staff Ron Klain in a memo released earlier this month. Klain said that between Jan. 25 and Feb. 1, Biden will focus on criminal justice reform, healthcare access and immigration system and border policies. Biden has signed more orders in his first week than any president in history; former President Donald Trump issued five in his first week as president. Biden's notable executive orders have been widely covered by outlets across the political spectrum; many provided analysis of the individual orders. Some right-rated outlets compared Biden's actions to those of Trump and other past presidents.
TITLE=> Two Appointments for Acting Director of CFPB. ARTICLE=> Outgoing director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Richard Cordray announced that he would appoint his chief of staff, Leandra English, to deputy director on Friday. Later that day, President Trump announced that he was appointing Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney as acting director of the bureau. There is little precedent for these conflicting appointments as each side now argues their case for why they should get to appoint the deputy director.
TITLE=> Democrats Warnock, Ossoff Projected to Win Georgia Runoffs; Party Will Likely Control Senate. ARTICLE=> Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are projected to defeat incumbent Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in Georgia's two U.S. Senate runoff elections. The victories would put the Democratic party in control of the Senate; there would be exactly 50 senators from each party, but Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would have the power to break ties once sworn in. Ossoff's defeat of Perdue and Warnock's defeat of Loeffler were each decided by less than 100,000 votes. Georgia hasn't had a Democrat senator since 2000. Updated 1/6/21 at 4:32 p.m. with Ossoff's projected win.
TITLE=> US House Passes The Equality Act. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives voted 224-206 on Thursday to pass the Equality Act, a bill which would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The act expands protections from discrimination based on sex to protections from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; it also expands on a 2020 Supreme Court ruling protecting some LGBTQ+ rights, including employment, education, housing, credit, jury service and other areas. The bill would cover federally funded programs and public accommodations, and also says it would trump the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which causes alarm for those concerned with religious liberty. The Democratic-led House had passed the measure before in 2019, but was killed by Senate Republicans. Currently, Democrats control both chambers of Congress, though the bill will likely meet resistance in the Senate, where it will need 60 votes to overcome a legislative filibuster. Coverage on all sides of the political spectrum provided speculation about the bill's chances of passing through the Senate, and highlighted the ideological clash between liberals who support the bill and conservatives concerned with religious freedom.
TITLE=> Economy's Q2 Growth Tops Pre-Pandemic Levels but Misses Expectations. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 6.5% in the second quarter of 2021, according to a Bureau of Economic Analysis report released Thursday. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.6% from Q1 of 2021, and is now higher than it was before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some economic analysts and experts reportedly expected annualized Q2 growth to be closer to 8.5%. Left-rated outlets often focused on the rapid pace of growth, quoting optimistic sources and placing less attention on the fact that the final number missed economists' expectations. Center- and right-rated outlets highlighted the growth while also framing it as underwhelming, attributing the shortcomings to labor shortages, supply chain issues, and concerns about the Delta variant.
TITLE=> Hamas Rockets, Israeli Airstrikes Continue for Second Day. ARTICLE=> Hamas and Israel continued firing rockets and launching airstrikes on Tuesday, marking a second day of violence after two Israelis and 28 Palestinians, including 10 Palestinian children, were killed Monday. The violence comes after weeks of growing tensions between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police over Israel’s attempts to evict Palestinian families from East Jerusalem. Additionally, Israeli police blocked Palestinians from accessing certain parts of Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and a Jewish supremacy group chanted “Death to Arabs” as it marched through the city. Clashes broke out on multiple nights at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, where an Israeli police raid left 305 Palestinians injured on Monday. Later that day, Palestinian militant group Hamas fired over 150 rockets from Gaza at Israel. Israel responded by launching at least 130 airstrikes in Gaza, which it said targeted Hamas operatives. Monday was also Jerusalem Day, when Israelis celebrate the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem.  Coverage from right-rated outlets focused more on Hamas’ attacks, referring to them as “terrorists,” as well as U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s remarks calling the Israeli airstrikes “an act of terrorism.” Additionally, the New York Post received online criticism over a misleading headline. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to discuss the clashes leading up to the Hamas rocket attacks. Editor's Note, 5/11/21 at 1:45 pm: Our original summary described the 1967 annexation as covering "the entire city." We've updated this description for clarity.

Specifically, the bill includes $52 billion for semiconductor production, invests in technologies like artificial intelligence, and creates a new technology directorate at the National Science Foundation. The bill, titled the U.S. Competition and Innovation Act, was initially sponsored by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) in April and faced weeks of debate before it was passed. The Chinese government issued a statement Wednesday morning expressing its “strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition” to the bill. The bill will now go to the House of Representatives, which may amend it; President Joe Biden said he looked forward to “signing it into law as soon as possible” in a statement issued Tuesday. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum. Some coverage described the bill as historically significant, with the New York Times calling it “the most significant government intervention in industrial policy in decades” and Fox News saying it could be the “most significant bipartisan achievement for current Congress.”

An investigation was opened up after a noose was reportedly seen in his garage stall, but the FBI reported that the rope had been there since October 2019. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the FBI's results, while coverage from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted the fact that Wallace had received death threats after his successful campaign to ban the Confederate flag. When it comes to wording, right-rated outlets also often used quotation marks when mentioning the word "noose," while several left-rated outlets made full use of the word in their headlines, and center-rated outlets tended to use more neutral terms like "rope."

That number rose 18% from the previous 12-month period, and some public health officials say it's likely an undercount. The figure represents the highest amount of drug overdose deaths in any year-long period in U.S. history. The news was covered by outlets across the spectrum, but mainly by center and right-rated sources. The reports often explained how people struggling with substance abuse suffered withdrawals and other complications when COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic lockdowns began. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to suggest that some drug-related deaths and other "deaths of despair" had been caused by overreaching pandemic restrictions, and also that the issue was carelessly overlooked by public officials and the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Israel, often regarded as the United States' most important ally in the Middle East, could oust Netanyahu by forming a coalition government between the Blue and White and left-leaning parties. The final results of the election will be reported next Wednesday. Right-leaning coverage has often covered Netanyahu more favorably than left-leaning media outlets, who more frequently report on potential indictments of Netanhayu that could occur if he were to lose his executive position.
TITLE=> US Soldier Charged With Plotting Against Own Unit, Leaking Info to Neo-Nazis. ARTICLE=> A U.S. Army soldier was charged with leaking his own unit's overseas deployment information to an extremist group, with the intention of getting the group to attack his unit. Pvt.

A video posted to Twitter shows multiple protesters physically assaulting Ngo and throwing milkshakes at him. Portland Police said the milkshakes thrown during the rally may have had quick-dry cement in them. Those on the right condemned aggression from left-wing "Antifa" demonstrators and criticized the left, saying they failed to strongly denounce Ngo's beating. Reporters on the left and in the center mentioned Ngo, but focused on the protest and its connection to the sentencing of James Fields Jr., who was sentenced to life in prison for driving his truck into demonstrators at a "Unite the Right" rally in Virginia in 2017, killing one.
TITLE=> Mail-In Ballots Delay Primary Election Results. ARTICLE=> Officials are awaiting primary election results in New York, Kentucky and Virginia as coronavirus precautions cause a surge of absentee mail-in ballots. Due to the high volume of mail-in ballots, New York and Kentucky estimate their results will be released June 30. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum focused on the absentee ballot counting process and on the results which were immediately ready, such as Mitch McConnell's Kentucky victory and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's win in New York. Some left-rated outlets analyzed leading candidates and their odds of winning, while several right-rated outlets also highlighted voters' outrage at the limited number of in-person polling sites.

In a statement, Manger said "The challenges in protecting the Capitol campus...have never been more complex," and commended "the courage and dedication" of the agency on Jan. 6. The story received wide coverage from left and center-rated outlets. Left-rated outlets often highlighted the challenges and purportedly low morale that the U.S. Capitol police department faces; right-rated outlets tended to focus on the story's basic details.

The coronavirus is reportedly surging in several states including California, which reported a record two-day total of 1,042 coronavirus deaths on Thursday. Illinois joined California, New York, Florida and Texas in reporting more than a million cases. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight the fact that the virus news came on the same day that protesters breached the Capitol building, pointing to political division as a stumbling block in the fight against the pandemic. The virus news received less coverage overall from right-rated outlets; New York Post and Washington Times covered the story.

TITLE=> Former Deputy AG Criticizes FBI, Defends Mueller in Testimony on Russia Probe. ARTICLE=> Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's Wednesday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee thrust the infamous Russia probe back into the spotlight. During questioning, Rosenstein was critical of FBI leadership's handling of the investigation, and defensive of his own decision to appoint Special Counsel Robert Mueller to lead a thorough probe of the allegations against the Trump campaign. The news was covered prominently on all sides of the media spectrum Wednesday, but particularly on the right; coverage from many right-rated outlets concentrated primarily on Rosenstein's admission that he would not have signed a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant renewal for former Trump adviser Carter Page if "he knew then what he knows now". Coverage from left-rated outlets conversely focused more on Rosenstein's defense of Mueller's investigation, while coverage from center-rated media generally gave similar spotlights to both elements.

Democrats and Republicans are currently split 204/190 in House of Representatives races, with Democrats favored to retain their majority. Overall, Democrats are underperforming polling expectations, and this is reflected in news coverage across bias ratings. Outlets on all sides covered overall congressional election results and focused on the election wins of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "Squad" and Republican Madison Cawthorn, who at 25 will be the youngest member of Congress; some coverage focused on Cawthorn's "Cry more, lib" tweet following his victory. Coverage in some left- and center-rated outlets focused on wins for Democrats Ritchie Torres and Mondaire Jones, the first openly gay black members of Congress, and Republicans Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have voiced support for QAnon.

TITLE=> Kavanaugh on Same-Sex Marriage. ARTICLE=> Although Kavanaugh's judicial record has no decisions related to LGBT rights, some have expressed fear that he will vote against the interests of the minority community.

Trump has maintained that he did nothing wrong; House intelligence committee Chariman Adam Schiff (D-CA) likened the phone call to a "mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader."

TITLE=> Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks TikTok App Store Ban. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily granted TikTok’s request for a temporary injunction against the Department of Commerce’s ban of the app in U.S. app stores, just four hours before the ban was to be implemented. TikTok had argued that the ban was infringing on free speech and acting in a capricious manner. The judge’s ruling does not stop the Commerce Department’s broader restrictions, which would make the app “unusable,” slated for November 12. The Commerce Department's ban aims to follow executive orders signed by President Trump in August. The ruling received relatively more coverage in center- and left-rated outlets than in right-rated outlets. Coverage of certain facts, like criticisms in Chinese media and TikTok owner ByteDance’s business negotiations, varied across all bias ratings. Some center- and left-rated outlets described the blocked ban as “Trump’s ban,” and some other outlets on all sides attributed the ban to the “Trump administration.”
TITLE=> Busch Cuts Ties With Viral Student After Reporter Surfaces Old Tweets; Reporter Also Found to Have Offensive Tweets. ARTICLE=> Anheuser-Busch has severed ties with viral fundraising sensation Carson King after Des Moines Register reporter Aaron Calvin surfaced some potentially offensive tweets of King's from eight years ago.

King has since apologized for the tweets. Meanwhile, Calvin has now come under scrutiny for similar tweets of his own, and has since locked his Twitter account. The Register is investigating Calvin internally; AllSides has yet to rate the Register. Media coverage has been mixed: left-leaning voices have condemned both King and Calvin, though acknowledging King's apology as sincere. Right-leaning voices criticized people for taking down King due to his actions at 16; some also deplored 'PC culture.'
TITLE=> Florida Gov. DeSantis Signs ‘Anti-Riot’ Law. ARTICLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a new “anti-riot” law on Monday which aims to respond to 2020’s George Floyd protests. “If you look at the breadth of this particular piece of legislation, it is the strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement piece of legislation in the country,” DeSantis said. The law grants civil immunity to people who drive their cars into protesters who are blocking a road, raises new penalties for battery against police officers during a riot, prohibits damaging or defacing memorials, creates a new crime called “mob intimidation,” requires authorities to deny bail to arrested demonstrators until after their first court date, and makes local officials liable for lawsuits over personal and property damages if they are found to have interfered with law enforcement’s response to civil unrest. Coverage in mainstream outlets was mostly balanced, with most coverage labeling the law “controversial,” explaining its provisions, and quoting advocates and opponents. Coverage in some left- and center-rated outlets focused on the law’s more unusual elements, such as making it “OK to hit protesters with your car.”
TITLE=> US Adds 194,000 Jobs in September, Well Short of Estimates. ARTICLE=> The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported Friday that U.S. employment rose by 194,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Economists expected roughly 500,000 jobs added. The BLS report highlighted "notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, in professional and business services, in retail trade, and in transportation and warehousing," and also noted a decline in employment in public education. Average hourly earnings climbed 19 cents to $30.85 in September. The workforce has gained 17.4 million jobs since a low in April 2020, but remains roughly 5 million below its pre-pandemic level. 	The September jobs report was covered prominently across the spectrum Friday. Many sources, regardless of bias, framed the news as a major disappointment, though one analysis from the New York Times (Lean Left bias) said the numbers reflect a more rapid recovery than previous ones. Reports from left-rated sources often framed the disappointing numbers as a result of the continued COVID-19 pandemic. Some left-rated voices juxtaposed the underwhelming job gains with the fact that over 8 million people lost pandemic unemployment benefits in September. 
TITLE=> Census Reports Record-Low Population Growth, Changes to House Seats. ARTICLE=> The U.S. population grew at the second-lowest rate in American history over the last decade, the Census Bureau reported Monday. The lowest rate came in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Demographic shifts led California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York to each lose a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, while Oregon, Montana, Colorado, Florida, and North Carolina each gained a seat, with Texas gaining two seats. This would be the first time in U.S. history that California has lost a House seat. In total, the U.S. population was measured at 331,449,281 as of April 1, 2020. Low population growth is not unique to the U.S.; several countries also saw slow population growth over the last decade, including China, Brazil and more. Some countries, mostly in Europe, have seen shrinking populations.  News outlets from across the spectrum covered the low growth rates and the reallocated House seats, usually in separate articles. Several local news outlets published coverage on how the census numbers would impact their individual states.

The White House says the order is an "initial step" towards improving access to voter registration services and information, helping federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, and pushing an overhaul of the government’s Vote.gov website. It also includes a provision to provide voting access and education to citizens in federal custody. Biden also called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law in 1965 following the Bloody Sunday protests, and to pass the For the People Act, which was approved by the House Wednesday in a near party-line vote. The executive order received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Coverage from some right-rated outlets tended to highlight the aspect of the bill that gives voting access to those in federal custody. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to analyze the contents of the order, while also detailing the history of Bloody Sunday.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Media's Handling of Hunter Biden's Alleged Emails. ARTICLE=> Hunter Biden's emails allegedly implicating his father Joe Biden in corrupt foreign business dealings, as first reported by the New York Post, have been the subject of mass media controversy and censorship since the article about them was published. The story was suppressed by Twitter and Facebook due to concerns about misinformation and sourcing (the Post is still suspended from using is Twitter account as of Oct. 27), and right-rated media outlets covered the story heavily while many left- and center-rated outlets didn't, saying they shared the social media platforms' concerns. Some left-rated voices said the alleged emails should be treated as potential disinformation from the outset and then carefully vetted, drawing comparisons between this situation and the foreign interference ahead of the 2016 election. Many right-rated voices said that mainstream media outlets are moving to protect Biden, focusing on the stated decisions by NPR (Center) and others to avoid covering the story, and arguing that questionably-sourced stories about Trump are not treated the same way.

A Justice Department legal opinion conducted at Biden's request found Saul can be removed despite a rule that states he could only be fired for neglect or malfeasance. Saul told the Washington Post Friday he considers himself the "term-protected Commissioner of Social Security" and challenged the legality of the decision. Deputy Commissioner David Black agreed to resign at the request of the White House. Biden named Kilolo Kijakazi, deputy commissioner for retirement and disability policy, as acting commissioner as the White House searches for a permanent replacement.  The story was covered by outlets across the political spectrum. Outlets from across the spectrum covered the history of Saul's clash with Biden during the president's six months in office.

TITLE=> Jobless Claims Soar to 6.6 Million. ARTICLE=> A record 6.6 million Americans filed first-time jobless claims last week, according to the Labor Department.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Trump Campaign's Election Lawsuits. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's campaign filed an election-related lawsuit in Arizona on Saturday after the campaign's lawsuits in Georgia and Michigan were dismissed earlier this week. Trump's campaign is also fighting Philadelphia election officials over vote counting, and attempted to intervene in a Supreme Court case challenging a decision that allowed election officials to count mail-in ballots delivered through Friday that were postmarked by Election Day. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News that it would be "wrong for [Trump] to concede" and teased potential lawsuits in up to ten states due to concerns about election transparency. The lawsuits were filed in hopes of overturning state results that projected Joe Biden as the lection's winner; some legal analysis say the lawsuits' narrow scope is unlikely to change the outcome of the presidential race. Right-rated outlets tended to cover and provide analysis of the Trump campaign's lawsuits and Giuliani's remarks. Voices from left and center-rated outlets frame Trump's legal actions as an effort to delegitimize the 2020 election in the eyes of many Americans.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Senate Group to Introduce Two-Part Coronavirus Relief Package.

The first piece of the relief package would be $748 billion allotted to schools and health care, while the other would designate $160 billion for local governments with a temporary liability shield. The potential stimulus package comes as 12 million Americans will lose unemployment benefits in the coming weeks. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to provide analysis regarding the potential stimulus package's effect on the economy, while some right-rated outlets highlighted Manchin's comments.

TITLE=> Texas Election Lawsuit Gains Some GOP Support; Others Cast Doubt. ARTICLE=> Texas announced lawsuits Tuesday against Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, accusing election officials there of illegally changing voting rules and allowing manipulation in the 2020 presidential election. The motions are backed by President Donald Trump, and more than 100 House Republicans signed an amicus brief Thursday supporting the lawsuits, which seek to overturn election results in the aforementioned states. Other prominent GOP lawmakers, including Senators John Cornyn (Tx.) and John Thune (S.D. ), cast doubt on the idea of the Supreme Court reviewing the suits. The 538 electors of the Electoral College will convene in their respective states Monday to officially cast their votes; state-certified election winner Joe Biden is expected to receive more than the 270 electoral votes needed to become president. Coverage on all sides focused on the internal Republican division. Some reports from left-rated sources framed the lawsuits as a longshot, focusing on similar previous legal challenges to election results that had been struck down by state courts in recent weeks. Some coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated on the text of the lawsuits and GOP support for them, as well as details of the allegations raised against the four states.
TITLE=> Pelosi Recalls House, Calls On USPS Postmaster General to Testify. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Sunday that the House of Representatives would be called back later this week to vote on a bill to stop the postmaster general's changes to the United States Postal Service (USPS) ahead of the 2020 election. Pelosi and other House Democrats also penned a letter Sunday calling on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Chairman of the USPS Board of Governors Robert Duncan to testify. This comes after Pelosi and 174 other House Democrats signed a letter raising concerns that DeJoy's changes, which reduce overtime and adjust delivery policies, could potentially affect mail-in voting. As of Sunday afternoon, coverage of this story was consistent across all sides of the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Left and Right Divided After Starbucks Asks 6 Police Officers to Leave. ARTICLE=> On July 4, a Tempe, AZ Starbucks employee asked 6 police officers to leave the establishment or move out of a customer's line of sight after the customer said the officers made them feel "unsafe." The officers had paid for drinks and left upon request. The story ignited debate on social media, and Twitter users created a viral hashtag, #boycottstarbucks, in protest of Starbucks' decision to ask the officers to leave. Starbucks has since issued a public apology. Last year, two black men were arrested for trespassing after they refused to leave a Philadelphia Starbucks when they had not ordered drinks. The men said they were waiting for a friend, who arrived as they were being taken away by police. Starbucks settled with the men privately, fired the employee who asked them to leave, and closed 8,000 U.S. stores for anti-bias training. Some on the right questioned why Starbucks would not close its 8,000 stores for anti-police bias training nor fire its employee following the Tempe incident. On the Right, Charlie Kirk, writing at Fox News, compared the treatment of the police officers to 1960s-era attitudes, in which black Americans were not served at segregated coffee shops. In the Center, Sheryl Atkisson, an award-winning investigative journalist who is married to a former police officer, defended police in general, saying "the vast majority of cops are good." And finally, Left author EJ Montini writes that conservatives calling for a Starbucks boycott are hypocritical because they did not do the same when the two black men were arrested in the Philly Starbucks.

ARTICLE=> Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) indicated Thursday that he wouldn't support a vote to call witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial despite his feeling that the president acted inappropriately with Ukraine, making Trump's acquittal more likely; four Republican senators will need to vote alongside the 47 Democratic senators to pass the motion for witnesses.

Some reports speculated on how each candidate would deliver their anniversary messages, with some coverage from from left-rated sources framing Trump as unfit to handle such sensitive moments. Some coverage from other sources, particularly right-rated outlets, concentrated on purportedly unjust delays in the trial of five men suspected of plotting the attacks.

TITLE=> ViacomCBS Fires Nick Cannon for Anti-Semitic Comments. ARTICLE=> ViacomCBS, the parent company of MTV, has ended its relationship with Nick Cannon over purportedly anti-Semitic comments Cannon made on a podcast. Cannon, who was the host of MTV and VH1's Wild n' Out and a former America's Got Talent host, is not the only celebrity under fire for anti-Semitism this week; NFL player DeSean Jackson apologized after glorifying Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on social media. Cannon apologized for his comments, but argued via Facebook that ViacomCBS unethically deprived him of the rights to Wild 'n Out. Coverage from right-rated outlets framed both Cannon and ViacomCBS in a critical light, not just for the comments in question but for Cannon's purportedly anti-white statements. Some right-rated voices took issue with the apparent reasoning for Cannon's firing not including what some argue were anti-white remarks. No coverage from left-rated outlets mentioned the purportedly anti-white comments as of early Wednesday afternoon.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Fourth of July 2021. ARTICLE=> The Fourth of July, also referred to as Independence Day, brings both celebration and debate each year. Many in the U.S. take the day to celebrate American independence and the values of freedom. There's sometimes a partisan divide over the holiday; some say the nation's history of slavery and oppression are also worthy of attention on Independence Day, and that celebrating freedom is complicated. Homepages looked vastly different across the political spectrum on Sunday. Right-rated outlets often celebrated Independence Day; some right-rated voices said that this country was "founded a nation expressly on the ideals of liberty," dismissing "mendacious" initiatives such as the 1619 Project. Some left-rated voices reminded Americans of their "debt to Black Americans" and argued that the holiday undermines black Americans' impact on U.S. history. Some center-rated voices advocated for unifying Americans around returning to traditional Fourth of July celebrations as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions are lifted.
TITLE=> Election Night Recap: Swing States Predict Delays, Trump Calls for SCOTUS Action. ARTICLE=> A presidential winner has yet to be announced as of Wednesday afternoon. The race remains close, and some states have suggested it could be several days before their results are fully counted. Biden said "we believe we're on track to win this election" to a Delaware crowd Tuesday evening, highlighting his "unexpected" leads in Arizona and Minnesota. Trump claimed Democrats were trying to "steal the election" in a now-flagged tweet Tuesday evening and in a press conference early Wednesday morning. "As far as I'm concerned, we won," the president said, also calling to halt vote counting and hinting at potential Supreme Court action. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on Pennsylvania and Michigan's likely delays, while some left-rated outlets framed Trump's victory claim as "false." Coverage from right-rated outlets focused on the details of Trump's speech and highlighted his election fraud claims, as well as Twitter's censorship of Trump's tweet. Updated 11/4/20 at 4:48 p.m. ET

TITLE=> Perspectives: WSJ Op-Ed Sparks Controversy Around Jill Biden's Doctorate. ARTICLE=> The Wall Street Journal published an opinion article on Dec. 11 calling for Dr. Jill Biden, wife of President-elect Joe Biden, to drop the “Dr.” title from her name because she is not a medical doctor. Dr. Jill Biden holds two master’s degrees and a doctorate in education from the University of Delaware. The article, which refers to Biden as “kiddo,” sparked politically polarized controversy that continued over the following week. WSJ Editorial Board Editor Paul Gigot responded to criticism of the article, writing, “these pages aren’t going to stop publishing provocative essays merely because they offend the new administration or the political censors in the media and academe.” The same day, Biden tweeted, “Together, we will build a world where the accomplishments of our daughters will be celebrated, rather than diminished.” Voices in right-rated outlets criticized Biden’s title and education, including her dissertation. Voices in left- and center- rated outlets tended to support Biden and describe criticisms of Biden’s title as “misogynistic.”

ARTICLE=> The recent surge in U.S. coronavirus cases raised questions about another stimulus package, but remarks by Senate leaders reveal Democrats and Republicans are still at an impasse when it comes to a relief bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged the need for another economic stimulus package Thursday, but maintained that the package should resemble the $500 billion package the Republican Party proposed before the election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that Democrats would block any bill similar to the previous GOP bill in favor of a bill closer to the $3 trillion HEROES Act passed by Democrats in May. Projected presidential election winner Joe Biden, speaking to Pelosi and Schumer Thursday, agreed on the need for a stimulus aid before January, and urged Congress to pass a bipartisan relief bill. The Senate leaders' remarks were covered by outlets across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Hong Kong: Protesters Clash With Police at Airport.

TITLE=> Pelosi Hair Salon Visit Sparks Criticism, Skewed Coverage. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited a closed San Francisco hair salon for a private appointment Monday, according to exclusive video obtained by Fox News. The salon's owner criticized Pelosi for purportedly breaking COVID-19 coronavirus rules; a spokesman for Pelosi said she "complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.” The story received significant social media attention, and has been covered prominently by the right side of the media after Fox published the first report Tuesday. Many reports and voices in right-rated outlets have painted Pelosi in a critical light, accusing her of hypocrisy and flouting virus guidelines. Center- and left-rated outlets have reported less frequently on the story, with coverage generally framing Republicans as having "pounced" on the opportunity to paint Pelosi as hypocritical. Some left-rated voices were critical of Pelosi for ostensibly giving President Donald Trump and Republicans an opportunity to question her credibility. Updated 9/2/20 at 2:03 p.m. ET

TITLE=> Thousands of Migrants Released Into US Despite White House Pledge to Deport. ARTICLE=> Thousands of unauthorized migrants congregated at a makeshift camp in Del Rio, Texas are reportedly being released into the United States, despite the Biden administration's pledge to deport people who cross the border illegally. An Associated Press (Center bias) report quoted an anonymous U.S. official who said migrants at the camp, who are mostly Haitian, have been released in recent days on a “very, very large scale.” The official also said many released migrants were given notices to appear at an immigration office within 60 days. Another anonymous official told AP that large numbers of migrants were being processed under immigration laws rather than being put on deportation flights to Haiti. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said during an appearance in Del Rio Monday that "if you come to the United States illegally, you will be returned." Reports across the spectrum highlighted criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the situation. Those criticisms were covered more prominently by right-rated news outlets, who often framed President Joe Biden's job on immigration as a major failure. Sources on left, right and center have also covered reports of migrants revolting or attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the apprehension and deportation process. Some reports from left- and center-rated sources focused on how many migrants were likely relieved by their release and looking forward to starting a new life in the U.S.
TITLE=> Hillary Clinton Blasts Bernie Sanders. ARTICLE=> Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (NY) blasted her former rival and current 2020 presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in a recent interview, and refused to commit to endorsing Sanders if he were to become the Democratic nominee later this year.

ARTICLE=> Fiona Hill, a former Russia expert on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a top aide at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, testified before House Intelligence Committee members Thursday in the week's final round of public impeachment hearings related to the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

TITLE=> U.S. Forces In Iraq "Repositioning," Says Pentagon. ARTICLE=> The U.S. military is planning to re-position forces in Iraq in the coming weeks "to prepare for onward movement," according to a letter sent to Iraqi officials from the top U.S. commander currently stationed in the country. The letter, released Monday, prompted confusion after Pentagon officials declined to confirm its authenticity, but was later confirmed by numerous sources; a nonbinding Iraqi Parliament vote cast Sunday to expel U.S. forces from the country caused initial speculation that the U.S. military would leave Iraq completely in the near future. Most reporting focused on details of potential troop movements and a total extraction's foreign policy implications; some outlets concentrated coverage on the apparent confusion among Pentagon officials.
TITLE=> Apple, Google and Amazon Ban Parler. ARTICLE=> Amazon removed Parler, a Twitter-like social media app popular among conservatives, from its cloud hosting service Sunday, joining Google and Apple in banning the app from their services this weekend. While Google and Apple's bans allowed people who had already downloaded the app to continue using it, Amazon's decision to remove Parler from its hosting service takes the app completely offline until the company "can find a new hosting service." Parler CEO John Matze called the move "a coordinated attack by the tech giants to kill the competition in the marketplace." Matze said Parler could be unavailable for up to a week while its servers are "rebuilt from scratch." Coverage from the left tended to frame Parler as an app people use to spread "hate" and coordinate events like Wednesday's Capitol protest. Some right-rated outlets highlighted Matze's statement, and framed the ban as unjust anti-conservative censorship and an attempt by Big Tech to control the marketplace.
TITLE=> U.S. Blocks United Nations Resolution Calling for Probe Into Gaza Violence. ARTICLE=> The United States has blocked a UN resolution that would investigate the clash between Israelis and Palestinians at the Gaza border on Monday. Supporters of the probe argue that Israel used unnecessary force, leading to the deaths of more than 50 Palestinians who were protesting as the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem. Detractors, however, emphasize the violent nature of the protests, asserting that Israel had to defend its border from antagonistic forces.
TITLE=> Trump Says he Received Coronavirus Test. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he has been tested for the coronavirus, with results still pending. Speaking to reporters during a press conference on the outbreak at the White House, Trump said he had taken the test the night before after being pressured by the media and others, many of whom argued the precaution was necessary given the Republican's recent contact with two people who have since tested positive for the virus. Coverage of the news was mostly straightforward, though some left-leaning outlets suggested the test should have come sooner.
TITLE=> Key Clean Energy Program Likely to Be Cut From Budget Bill. ARTICLE=> A key clean energy program in the Biden administration's multi-trillion dollar spending bill may be dropped due to opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) A report from the New York Times (Lean Left bias) published Sunday highlighted three anonymous congressional staffers and lobbyists who said the Clean Energy Performance Program (CEPP) would likely be cut; Manchin, a moderate Democrat, has told the White House that he strongly opposes the CEPP. The $150 billion program would provide financial incentives for utilities that transition to renewable energy and would fine those which do not. The spending bill needs support from all 50 Democratic senators in order to pass through the reconciliation process. The news was covered across the spectrum, with most reports framing the potential cut as a serious blow to President Joe Biden's climate change plan. Reports from left- and center-rated sources often framed Manchin in a negative light and highlighted his personal financial ties to the fossil fuel industry. Coverage from right-rated outlets sometimes framed the Biden administration's climate spending plan as excessive.
TITLE=> Trump Admin Considers New Immigration Plan. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration is considering a new immigration plan that would separate children from their parents when families are caught trying to cross the border illegally.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Senate's Debt Ceiling Standoff. ARTICLE=> Despite warnings that inaction could lead to an economic crisis, the U.S. Senate has reached a partisan impasse on suspending the debt ceiling. A short-term offer from Republicans to extend the debt limit into December is likely to be accepted by Democrats, but doesn't solve the issue of how the limit will be raised. Senate Republicans have promised for months to vote against and filibuster any debt ceiling vote, arguing that Democrats should suspend the debt ceiling by themselves through budget reconciliation. Senate Democrats can only use reconciliation once per fiscal year, and plan to use it to pass their planned $3.5 trillion social and economic policy bill, which is currently stalled by opposition from moderate Democratic senators.  Voices in right-rated outlets mainly backed up Senate Republicans’ arguments and criticized Democrats’ spending plans. Voices in left-rated outlets tended to criticize Republicans or attempt to offer alternative solutions. 
TITLE=> White House Releases Immigration Demands. ARTICLE=> The White House sent Congress an expansive set of principles that would sharply increase immigration enforcement at the border and inside the U.S. and significantly cut the number of new legal arrivals, demanding a high price for legislation under consideration to help “Dreamers.”
TITLE=> Perspectives: Juneteenth 2020. ARTICLE=> Friday, June 19 is the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth, the date symbolizing the final emancipation of enslaved persons after the Civil War. This year's commemoration comes as the U.S. wrestles with racial tension, civil unrest and violent demonstrations after the death of George Floyd in police custody. Voices from left to right and throughout the political spectrum focused on the day's importance to the black community, with many expressing hope that the commemoration could help unite a seemingly split nation. Some activists, pundits and politicians are advocating for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.
TITLE=> Fact Checking the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders Debate. ARTICLE=> Sunday's one-on-one debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) concentrated on responding to the COVID-19 coronavirus, overall political strategy and the candidates' competing ideologies. Media coverage focused heavily on apparently misleading statements by both candidates, including claims about previous policy stances and campaign funding. Coverage from throughout the political spectrum also focused on Biden's commitment to choosing a female running mate; Sanders said he'd also choose a female running mate "in all likelihood."
TITLE=> Trump Blasts Iran as Protests Boil Over. ARTICLE=> As anti-government protests continue in Iran, President Trump tweeted that it is "time for change". He continued, stating that "the people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime.

TITLE=> Bipartisan Bill Introduced to Repeal Cadillac Tax. ARTICLE=> A resolution has been introduced to repeal the 'Cadillac Tax,' a part of the Affordable Care Act, in a show of bipartisanship. The right-leaning and left-leaning guest writers cited below offer opinions on how their parties should deal with the issue. The left-leaning opinion advocates for reshaping the Cadillac tax rather than trying to kill it; the right-leaning opinion says conservatives should take advantage of any chance for bipartisanship.
TITLE=> House Dems Introduce New $3 Trillion Stimulus Proposal. ARTICLE=> House Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) introduced a new $3 trillion stimulus proposal on Tuesday. The package, titled the HEROES Act, would provide another round of checks to Americans similar to the CARES Act, as well as aid to healthcare workers and 'hazard pay' to essential workers. There are a few changes from the CARES Act; immigrants with Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) would be eligible for this round of checks, as are adult dependents and full-time students younger than 24. Republican leadership, meanwhile, is reportedly skeptical of another round of stimulus checks. Left and center-rated voices largely focused on nuances between previous policy and the HEROES Act, concentrating on purportedly positive features of the new proposal; such as additional checks and essential worker protections. Most right-rated coverage questioned the necessity of those same details, with some voices separately accusing Democrats of attempting to undermine the economy to turn voters against President Trump.
TITLE=> Bill Gates: Rich Countries 'Should Move to 100% Synthetic Beef'. ARTICLE=> Microsoft cofounder and CEO Bill Gates told MIT Technology Review in a recent interview that rich countries should switch to eating "100% synthetic beef" to reduce pollution and help the environment. "Eventually, that green premium is modest enough that you can sort of change the [behavior of] people or use regulation to totally shift the demand," Gates said in the interview. He singled out two brands, Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, as synthetic meat producers with "a quality road map and a cost road map that makes them totally competitive." The story got much more attention from right-rated outlets, who focused primarily on MIT's interview with Gates and his quote about synthetic beef for rich nations. Very few left- and center-rated sources covered the interview; CBS News (Lean Left bias) published its own story about Gates' views on sustainability and predictions for future effects of climate change.
TITLE=> Guyger Found Guilty of Murder. ARTICLE=> Amber Guyger, a former Dallas police officer, was found guilty Tuesday of murdering Botham Jean in September 2018. Guyger, a white female officer, shot and killed Jean, a black man, in his apartment that she mistook for her own after mistaking him for an intruder. The jury was asked to ponder whether Guyger should be charged with the less serious manslaughter. Guyger could face anywhere from five to ninety-nine years in jail under Texas law; her crime does not qualify for the death penalty. The case again highlighted the intersection of race and police brutality, adding fuel to the "Black Lives Matter" movement.
TITLE=> Fox News, Newsmax Walk Back Election Fraud Claims After Facing Legal Action From Voting Machine Manufacturers. ARTICLE=> Facing legal action, right-rated outlets Fox News and Newsmax have begun airing segments and publishing articles retracting allegations of election fraud regarding voting machines manufacturers Smartmatic and Dominion. This comes after Smartmatic sent a number of media outlets a letter last Monday threatening legal action if certain claims were not retracted. Smartmatic also sent a letter to former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, who originated claims that the two companies conspired with Democrats and the Venezuelan government to hand the election to Joe Biden. On Friday, Fox News aired a segment which appeared to retract many claims it made surrounding Smartmatic in an interview with Open Source Election Technology Institute director Eddie Perez on “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” Newsmax aired a segment Monday to "clarify" its coverage of Dominion and Smartmatic, saying, “Newsmax would like to clarify its news coverage and note that it has not reported as true certain claims made about these companies.”  The story was covered primarily by left- and center-rated outlets, though it received some coverage from right-rated outlets, including The Blaze, The Daily Caller and The Epoch Times.
TITLE=> Senate Republicans Block Democrats' Voting Rights Legislation. ARTICLE=> Republican senators unanimously blocked Democrats' election legislation, known as the For the People Act, on Tuesday. The bill would loosen voter ID requirements, allow registration on election day, and expand early voting dates; it passed the House in March, but fell 10 votes short of the 60 needed to pass the Senate. On Tuesday, Senate Rules Committee Chairman Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said of the bill “this is not the end of the line...this is only the beginning,” and pledged to hold more hearings to gain support for the bill across the country. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the bill "rotten" Tuesday, saying it was an attempt to "rig" elections in favor of Democrats. The bill's supporters say it would expand voter access among marginalized communities; opponents claim it poses a threat to election security and is an attempt by the Democratic Party to gain more power.  Outlets from the left and center tended to analyze the Democratic Party's next moves regarding the bill. Some outlets on the right highlighted GOP lawmaker's comments about the bill. 
TITLE=> Trump Officials Linked to Offshore Accounts. ARTICLE=> Less than one week after Trump reiterated his promise to "bring back trillions of dollars from offshore", millions of leaked documents revealed that several Trump officials have used offshore accounts to keep company finances or personal investments in tax havens, including Rex Tillerson, Ben Carson, and Steve Mnuchin.

ARTICLE=> Projected presidential election winner Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris gave their first interview since the Nov. 3 election Thursday on CNN. The interview covered a range of topics from Biden's Cabinet plans to President Donald Trump's potential pardons, but focused on COVID-19 coronavirus strategy. Biden said he will issue a standing order for masks to be worn in federal buildings and on public transportation, and he asked that masks be worn for the first 100 days after his inauguration. Biden also expressed support for Congress passing a compromise pandemic relief package before he takes office. Biden said he asked Dr. Anthony Fauci to be his chief medical adviser and part of his COVID-19 response team, and that when Fauci said it was safe, Biden would get the COVID-19 vaccine. The interview was covered by outlets across the political spectrum; most news outlets led with Biden's plans for coronavirus.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Call for Vaccine Mandates. ARTICLE=> The idea of mandating the COVID-19 vaccine has been one of the pandemic's more divisive issues, and that debate gained new momentum Thursday as President Joe Biden called for mandatory vaccines for roughly 100 million Americans. Biden said the vaccine should be mandated for federal employees, with no alternative option for weekly testing. He also called for private companies with 100+ workers to either mandate vaccines or test employees for COVID-19 weekly. Roughly 54% of Americans are fully vaccinated. A recent Gallup (Center bias) poll says majorities of Americans support vaccine mandates at offices, restaurants, hotels and events with large crowds. Biden's call for mandates prompted reactions from voices across the spectrum. Many left-rated voices expressed support for the move, framing Biden's efforts as a "war on the unvaccinated" and suggesting that the unvaccinated deserve significant blame for the continued COVID-19 pandemic and economic instability. Right-rated voices often opposed the mandates, with many arguing that though the vaccines have proven safe and effective, mandating them is an unconstitutional encroachment on personal liberty. Some also highlighted how Biden and other public officials expressed opposition to federal vaccine mandates until the past month or so.

Coverage on both sides examined potential consequences of more relief not being agreed on soon, and broke down the differences preventing an agreement. Some reports from right-rated sources focused on a Monday tweet from Trump saying that Democrats were ready to negotiate.

TITLE=> Biden Announces Six Gun Control Executive Actions. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration announced six “initial actions” on Thursday to address gun violence in America following mass shootings in Atlanta, Georgia and Boulder, Colorado. The actions include requiring background checks for “ghost guns,” untraceable guns made from parts bought online; categorizing pistols with arm brace modifications—like the one allegedly used in the Boulder shooting—as “rifles” under the National Firearms Act; publishing model “red flag” legislation for states; investing in “evidence-based community violence interventions”; directing the Justice Department to issue an annual firearms trafficking report; and nominating David Chipman, a gun control advocate, to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

TITLE=> Vatican Says Church 'Does Not and Cannot' Bless Same-Sex Unions.

The office was asked if "the Church have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons of the same sex?”, to which it responded: “Negative.” Pope Francis, who approved the statement, made headlines last year after he voiced support for civil union laws for same-sex couples. The Vatican says it's decision isn't "a form of unjust discrimination, but rather a reminder of the truth of the liturgical rite and of the very nature of the sacramentals, as the Church understands them." News outlets across the spectrum covered the story. Coverage was featured more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets, and less by right-rated sources. Some reports from left-rated sources framed the church's statement as adversarial, and focused on potential reactions from gay and lesbian Catholics around the world. Coverage from right-rated outlets often highlighted the church's reasoning for opposing same-sex unions, as well as the church's official encouragement that Christians "welcome with respect and sensitivity persons with homosexual inclinations."

ARTICLE=> TJ Ducklo, a national press secretary for the Biden campaign, claimed on Fox News Thursday that "the vice president was not against the travel ban" on China, which President Donald Trump enforced on January 31. When asked if Biden was for the China travel ban, Ducklo said he would send "fact checks." The day after Trump announced the travel ban, Biden tweeted on Feb 1, “We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering." On March 18, Trump used the words "Chinese Virus" in a tweet; Biden responded on Twitter by saying "Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering." On March 26, Trump stated in a Sean Hannity interview that, "I had (Joe) Biden calling me xenophobic. … He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.”  A fact check from left-rated fact checker site Politifact covered this story in March. Politifact said that while Biden didn't directly tie Trump's restrictions to xenophobia, Biden did not spell out which part of Trump’s tweet was xenophobic in his response. Center-rated FactCheck.org covered the story in July, framing Trump's comments about Biden as "misleading" and "unsupported," while pointing out that Biden did not take a position on the initial China travel ban.

ARTICLE=> Hervis Rogers, a Texas man who went viral on social media after standing in line for more than six hours to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, was arrested on two counts of illegal voting charges after casting a ballot while on parole. It is illegal for a citizen to knowingly vote while still under parole in Texas; the action is legal at least 20 states. Rogers' attorney, Andre Segura, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. Rogers, 62, was arrested in 1995 for burglary and intent to commit theft. His parole expired on June 13, 2020, and now faces prison time with these new charges. Many right-rated outlets emphasized that Rogers is a twice-convicted felon and linked the situation to the Republican-backed "voting integrity bill" that was halted by Democrats in May. Left-rated outlets featured quotes that sided more with Rogers and criticized the Republican's "voter suppression bill." Most center-rated outlets listed the facts pertaining to Rogers' arrest and his background before revealing opinions from sources.
TITLE=> U.S. Senate Votes to Pass Asian American Hate Crimes Bill.

Initially faced with the threat of a Republican filibuster, the bill ultimately passed with near-complete bipartisan support in the Senate after an agreement allowed for state and local government grants to help improve hate crime reporting; Republican Sen. Josh Hawley was the only senator to vote against the bill. The bill will now move onto the House for approval.  Coverage from left-rated tended to focus on the purported rise in COVID-19 related hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islander communities; some left-rated outlets also focused on Hawley's vote against the bill.

TITLE=> Half of U.S. Adult Population Has Received COVID-19 Vaccine.

The U.S. also announced that 81% of U.S. seniors over 65 have gotten at least one dose, and more than 65% U.S. seniors are fully vaccinated against the virus. The U.S. reached the milestone just days after Johns Hopkins University reported more than 3 million people around the world have died from COVID-19. Concerns about vaccine access have arisen also as developer Johnson & Johnson halts their vaccine distribution after several cases of people developing blood clots after getting the vaccine.

TITLE=> Trump Becomes First Sitting President to Enter North Korea. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for nearly an hour at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea. Both countries have agreed to form teams tasked with resuming nuclear negotiations. Trump said "tremendous progress" was made between the United States and North Korea, while Kim said he believes Trump is willing to "eliminate all the unfortunate past and open a new future." Some critics believe the meeting — the third face-to-face between Trump and Kim — was simply for show and not a sign of actual progress, especially because it was organized on such short notice. Others credit Trump for his willingness to negotiate and becoming the first sitting U.S. president to enter the country. It remains unclear whether or not North Korea is willing to meet Trump's goal of complete denuclearization, or if Trump is willing to settle for a partial accord.
TITLE=> Federal Judge Reverses California Ban on Assault Weapons. ARTICLE=> A U.S. judge overturned California's 32-year ban on assault weapons, claiming the ban violates the Second Amendment. U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego said that “under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive,” and wrote in his ruling, “Like the Swiss Army knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment. Good for both home and battle.” Benitez went on to write in his ruling that, “this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of Second Amendment protection...this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes.” Benitez provided state Attorney General Rob Bonta 30 days to appeal the ruling before the law takes effect; Bonta said in a statement Friday he would appeal Benitez’s decision, calling it "fundamentally flawed." California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Benitez for the ruling in a tweet, said comparing an AR-15 to a Swiss Army knife "is a disgusting slap in the face to those who have lost loved ones to gun violence" and that the ruling "is a direct threat to public safety and innocent Californians."  Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight Benitez's Swiss Army knife comparison, as well as backlash from Newsom and others on the left.

Gavin Newsom announced Friday that the state would require COVID-19 vaccination for school children, becoming the first U.S. state to do so. “The state already requires that students are vaccinated against viruses that cause measles, mumps, and rubella – there’s no reason why we wouldn’t do the same for COVID-19,” Newsom said. The new vaccine mandate is limited to in-person learning recipients and will begin with the first full school year after the FDA fully authorizes a COVID-19 vaccine for children. The mandate will initially be limited to children 12 and up in grades 7-12 and will later be extended to those entering kindergarten.  Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Friday evening, with most outlets framing the policy as the first “vaccine mandate” for U.S. school children.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Ranked-Choice Voting in NYC. ARTICLE=> New York City’s mayoral primary election ends Tuesday and features ranked-choice voting, an electoral method that has gained popularity in recent years. Instead of voting for one candidate, voters rank candidates by preference. In New York, voters rank their top five among the 13 Democratic primary candidates or the two Republican primary candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of the votes, the candidate with the least first-choice votes is eliminated and their voters' second choices are counted; this process is repeated until a candidate receives over 50% of the votes. In 2019, New Yorkers overwhelmingly voted in favor of implementing ranked-choice voting by a 3-1 margin. The top five contenders in this year’s Democratic primary, the winner of which is expected to win the general election, are Eric Adams, Andrew Yang, Kathryn Garcia, Scott Stringer, and Maya Wiley.  Voices were relatively balanced across the spectrum, noting that the new ranked-choice system could take weeks to declare a winner and that the outcome could affect the implementation of ranked-choice voting throughout the country.

Some protesters and activists are rallying around a cry to "defund the police." Some left-rated voices advocated for addressing systemic issues and reforming communities by reallocating significant funds from law enforcement to housing and education budgets. Several also called for an end to mass incarceration, police militarization, and police in schools. Some voices from the right argued that police systems should remain intact, pointing to possible correlations between cities with progressive law enforcement policies and rising crime rates. Many voices from all sides of the spectrum advocated for some form of police reform or reduced funding.

ARTICLE=> William Latson, a former high school principal who stirred controversy earlier this year when he claimed neutrality as to whether the Holocaust occurred or not, was let go by Spanish River High School in Boca Raton, Florida. His termination will be effective November 21st; school officials insist that his removal was not due to the controversy he stirred, but rather his lack of cooperation with school officials. Latson initially claimed neutrality due to his position as a school administrator, citing that because some people do not believe in the Holocaust, he cannot take a side.
TITLE=> Virus Testing is up Overall, but Some States May be Falling Behind. ARTICLE=> Conflicting headlines and different reporting angles have helped fuel confusion around the status of COVID-19 coronavirus testing in the United States, and whether or not the country is performing tests adequately, or if it's falling short. Some outlets are focusing on the recent overall increase in daily tests conducted in the U.S., while others are singling out certain states and regions that are still reportedly experiencing a lack of testing. Others, especially right-rated outlets, concentrated on issues purportedly born out of inefficient testing requirements and mandates. Data from Pew Research Center suggests that 61% of Americans think the federal government is responsible for ensuring sufficient testing, rather than state governments.
TITLE=> Acquittal in Philando Castile Case. ARTICLE=> A Minnesota police officer was acquitted of manslaughter after fatally shooting Philando Castile last July.

The President and White House say the executive order is aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus cases. Some left-rated voices and immigration advocates say Trump is using the pandemic to fuel his purportedly xenophobic agenda. Some right-rated voices and anti-immigration activists say the order doesn't go far enough, and question why the president didn't make a similar move sooner.
TITLE=> Social Media Platforms Censor Election Posts from Trump, Others. ARTICLE=> Facebook and Twitter put warning labels on posts about the election they deemed "potentially misleading," including President Donald Trump's early Wednesday tweet claiming that "Democrats were trying to steal the election" and his tweet that he's "claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes" wins in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. Twitter put warning labels on a tweet from a Daily Wire reporter Matt Walsh regarding an update on a purported 128,000 votes for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden after Trump also retweeted the post. Later,  an update from Decision Desk HQ reported that the tweet from Walsh concerning an influx of 138,339 Biden votes in Michigan has now been clarified by Decision Desk HQ as an “error.”  Coverage from left-and center-rated outlets tended to frame Trump's tweets as "unconfirmed" and "baseless," while right-rated coverage tended to frame the story as censorship of conservative voices.

ARTICLE=> House Republicans, seeking the biggest change in the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years, aim to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, compress the number of individual income tax brackets, and repeal the taxes paid by large estates starting in 2024.
TITLE=> Former Secretary of State Colin Powell Dies at 84. ARTICLE=> Former Secretary of State Colin Powell died at the age of 84 from COVID-19 complications, his family said Monday. Powell, who was fully vaccinated, was being treated at Walter Reed National Medical Center and was reportedly also suffering from multiple myeloma. After decades of military service, Powell served as Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H. Bush and then as Secretary of State for President George W. Bush.  He was a four-star general who was often mentioned as a possible candidate for president, but never ran. President Joe Biden released a statement Monday calling Powell a "dear friend and a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity." 	The news was covered prominently across the spectrum Monday, with most recalling Powell's military career and work as Secretary of State. Some left-rated sources framed Powell's handling of the Iraq War in a negative light. 
TITLE=> Biden Chooses Xavier Becerra to Lead Health and Human Services. ARTICLE=> Projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden has picked California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be his Secretary of Health and Human Services, putting a defender of the Affordable Care Act in a leading role to oversee his administration's COVID-19 coronavirus response.

TITLE=> Stocks Fall Nearly 10% as Economic Concerns Continue Over Coronavirus.

TITLE=> World Leaders React To US-UK-Australia Nuclear Submarine Deal. ARTICLE=> The new security partnership between the US, UK and Australia — titled "AUKUS" — has sparked backlash from various world leaders who feel compromised by the alliance. Announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, the alliance between the three English-speaking nations is meant to strengthen their security interests through cooperation on defense technology. AUKUS' first major initiative will be to supply Australia with a new nuclear-powered submarine fleet, resulting in the cancellation of Australia's $90 billion deal with France to build submarines. Describing the partnership as “treason in the making,” French ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault said on Saturday that Australia has made a “huge mistake” that showcased “unacceptable behavior between allies and partners.” The French Embassy also canceled an event that would have recognized the 240th anniversary of a Revolutionary War battle, an event that symbolized strong cooperation between the U.S. and France. While Australia is not looking to develop its own nuclear weapons, New Zealand was absent from the deal due to its nuclear-free policy; Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated Thursday that Australia's nuclear submarines will be banned from New Zealand waters. Most stories across the spectrum noted how the AUKUS partnership has "aggravated already tense relations" with China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called on the alliance to abandon their "outdated Cold War zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical stability," indicating that their deal has "intensified the arms race."
TITLE=> Trump Administration Misses Deadline to Reunite Migrant Children with Parents. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration has reunited 38 out of 102 migrant children under age 5 with their parents, missing the Tuesday court deadline set by a federal judge.

Some left-leaning voices rebuked the White House for not allowing the House to conduct oversight duties; many right-leaning voices have derided the inquiry as a political stunt that has little to do with oversight.

TITLE=> Biden Administration to Allow Some Asylum Seekers to Enter US After Trump’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ Policy. ARTICLE=> The Department of Homeland Security announced Friday that it plans to allow thousands of mostly non-Mexican asylum seekers, forced to wait in northern Mexico under the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, to enter the U.S. while they await their immigration court hearings. Beginning Feb. 19, the DHS will allow about 600 of the estimated 25,000 asylum seekers with “active cases” to enter the U.S. each day. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas cautioned that “individuals who are not eligible under this initial phase should wait for further instructions and not travel to the border,” citing the pandemic and the ongoing humanitarian crisis. As of Friday afternoon, relatively few right-rated outlets had published original reporting on this story. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to describe the poor conditions in which many of the thousands of asylum seekers are currently living.
TITLE=> Clintons, Bushes, Obamas, and Melania Trump Attend Funeral of Barbara Bush. ARTICLE=> The media celebrated the unique display of unity at Barbara Bush's funeral after a picture of the Clintons, Bushes, Obamas, and Melania Trump circulated online.

Transcripts of the call were released by Yilek via both the Examiner and Twitter.
TITLE=> Biden Says US ‘On Pace’ to Meet Aug. 31 Afghanistan Withdrawal Deadline. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. was on track to meet his Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, first in an emergency virtual meeting of G-7 leaders and again in a speech from the White House. Meeting this deadline would require “continued coordination with the Taliban, including continued access for evacuees to the airport,” a White House statement said, adding that Biden had “asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timeline should that become necessary.” Meanwhile, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid demanded that the U.S. stick to the Aug. 31 deadline and said that “the road to Kabul airport is closed for locals and open to foreigners.” Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on criticisms of the deadline announcement and framed Biden's decision to stick to the deadline as a capitulation to the Taliban; the New York Post called the White House's request for contingency plans a “stunning reversal.” Some coverage seemed to differ on whether the Taliban would block fleeing Afghans now or after the Aug. 31 deadline.
TITLE=> Trump Meets with Supreme Court Contenders.

TITLE=> US Economic Productivity to Reach Pre-Pandemic Levels by Mid-2021, CBO Says. ARTICLE=> U.S. GDP will likely return to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2021 and surpass its potential level in early 2025, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released Monday. The civilian labor force and the employment rate are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022 and 2024, respectively. Real GDP growth is expected to hit 4.6% in 2021 and then decline, resulting in an average rate of 2.6% annually until 2025. The CBO also said that while recent coronavirus stimulus legislation will boost real GDP by 1.5% in 2021 and 2022, it will also “add $774 billion to the deficit in fiscal year 2021 and $98 billion in 2022.” The CBO report does not account for any new or proposed legislation after Jan. 12. Coverage in outlets on all sides included both growth and deficit numbers. Business-focused outlets tended to feature coverage of this story more prominently. Coverage varied widely in highlighting different numbers, particularly on whether the “labor market” would recover by 2022 or 2024.
TITLE=> Clashes in Gaza Before US Embassy Opening. ARTICLE=> At least 37 Palestinians have been killed and 1,300 wounded by Israeli troops in clashes on the Gaza border ahead of the US embassy opening in Jerusalem.
TITLE=> Tax Overhaul Passes 51-49. ARTICLE=> The GOP tax overhaul passed the Senate 51-49 late Friday night after a new version was given to senators hours prior to the vote.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Military Leaders' Testimony on Afghanistan Withdrawal Contradicts Biden. ARTICLE=> Top U.S. military leaders are testifying before Congress this week about the recent withdrawal from Afghanistan, and at times have contradicted the image of the situation put forth by President Joe Biden. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, called the withdrawal a "logistical success but strategic failure" on Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In remarks directly following the withdrawal on Aug. 31, Biden called it an "extraordinary success." Milley and Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, each said they recommended to Biden that 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan. Biden said previously that his decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan did not go against military leaders' advice, and that he was not told of a recommendation to leave a small troop presence behind. Right-rated voices highlighted how the country's top military leaders seemed to be at odds with much of the president's decision-making, framing it as a sign of Biden's purported incompetence as president. Conversely, some left-rated voices said the leaders' testimonies worked in Biden's favor, arguing that they proved that the narrative of a failed withdrawal was "exaggerated and lacked context" and focusing more on the notion that the entire Afghanistan war was a failure. Others on the left disagreed, and said the leaders' testimonies "punched holes" in Biden's public defense of the withdrawal.
TITLE=> CDC Drafts Guidelines for Initial Reopenings; White House to Review. ARTICLE=> The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly drafted new guidelines for phased reopenings of certain businesses and public settings, as COVID-19 coronavirus restrictions are slowly being relaxed in some regions of the U.S. The guidelines focus on specific sectors and organizations, which include schools, workplaces, churches, restaurants and public transportation; they're likely to be announced at some point in the next seven days. Some left-rated outlets concentrated specifically on the fact that the guidelines still have to be thoroughly reviewed, possibly tweaked and approved by the White House.
TITLE=> Mental Health and Suicide During a Pandemic. ARTICLE=> Suicides, drug overdoses and other so-called "deaths of despair" have emerged as possible consequences of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, in addition to the virus itself. Many experts say it's too early to determine whether the pandemic is creating a legitimate increase in these deaths, but most also warn of the various adverse psychological effects one can experience in such uncertain times. Mental health has been the focus of widespread coronavirus news coverage, as well as the pandemic's impact on the opioid crisis and other preexisting public heath concerns. Many reports, particularly from right-rated sources, focused on calls to end shelter-in-place orders from a California doctor who cited an "unprecedented" number of recent COVID-19-linked suicides.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Sides with Police in Qualified Immunity Cases. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that police officers in two cases were entitled to qualified immunity, a key issue for police reform advocates. No dissent was filed in either case. In both cases, the Court argued that lower courts had improperly applied past cases as precedent for defining the officers’ actions as having violated "clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” The first case involved an officer kneeling on the plaintiff’s back for eight seconds; the other involved multiple officers lethally shooting a man after he grabbed a hammer and raised it at them.  Coverage was somewhat more common in left- and center-rated outlets than right-rated outlets on Monday. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with some outlets focusing only on the case itself and others including the political context surrounding qualified immunity. 
TITLE=> New Sanctions on Iran. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Friday kept the Iran nuclear deal by waiving sanctions for the third time, but he said he will not grant another reprieve unless the agreement is amended to permanently block a potential pathway for Iran to build nuclear weapons.

Iran said on Saturday it would retaliate against the new sanctions.

TITLE=> Justice Dept. Sues Georgia Over Voting Law, Saying it Restricts Black Vote. ARTICLE=> The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday that it is suing the state of Georgia over its new voting law. "Georgia enacted S.B. 202 with knowledge of the disproportionate effect that numerous provisions, both singly and together, would have on Black voters’ ability to participate in the political process on an equal basis with white voters," the lawsuit states. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) argues that the law expands voter access throughout the state, and says the DOJ lawsuit was "born out of the lies and misinformation the Biden administration has pushed against Georgia’s Election Integrity Act." The law, enacted in March, enhances requirements for absentee voting and limits the number of ballot drop boxes per county. 	Coverage from left-rated outlets often framed Georgia's law as discriminatory, and described it as a consequence of former President Donald Trump's false 2020 election claims. Reports from right-rated sources tended to focus on criticism of the DOJ lawsuit, including from Trump.
TITLE=> Debate Heats Up Over When, How to Reopen Schools for the Fall. ARTICLE=> Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director Robert Redfield said Thursday that guidance for reopening schools would not be revised following criticism from President Donald Trump, the latest development in the politicized public health debate about returning children to in-person education in the fall. Coverage on all sides of the spectrum, especially the left and center, focused on Trump's push to reopen schools; some reports framed his effort in the context of restarting the economy and bolstering his reelection chances. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused more on the CDC's stated goal for the guidelines to encourage safe reopenings, not paint them as improbable. Left-rated voices generally explore the potential safety risks of reopening schools too early or without proper planning. Many right-rated voices have focused on the purported psychological consequences suffered by children who spend an extended period of time away from the classroom and social settings.

TITLE=> Recap of Day Two: Amy Coney Barrett Confirmation Hearings. ARTICLE=> Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearings continued Tuesday on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Barrett was questioned about her stances on abortion, healthcare, LGBT rights and other social issues that are often politicized. Most coverage from left-rated sources and some center-rated sources framed Barrett's answers as evasive or vague; many focused on her perceived stances on social issues and how her nomination may purportedly endanger rights for women and the LGBTQ+ community. Coverage from right-rated outlets was generally less speculative about how Barrett's potential future decisions could impact policy changes; some painted Senate Democrats' questions as bizarre.
TITLE=> Perspectives: China Fosters Strong Relations With Afghanistan Following Taliban Takeover. ARTICLE=> As the U.S. removes itself from Afghanistan, many voices across the spectrum seem to agree that the Taliban’s takeover could present an array of political and economic opportunities for China. Chinese officials have been critical of America’s “hasty” retreat from Afghanistan, and have announced that they are ready to help rebuild the impoverished nation. In return for offering the Taliban "political impartiality and economic investment," China could gain more control over Afghanistan's reserve of rare earth minerals that are said to be worth north of $1 trillion.  Perspectives from both the left and right criticized President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan, suggesting that the U.S. should strengthen ties with allies across southeast and central Asia in an attempt to curb China’s ambitions. Some right-rated voices highlighted how the U.S. abandoning its position as a superpower that maintains "peace through strength" could result in chaos and unwanted consequences. Other right-rated voices suggested that the U.S. will have to hold the Taliban's weapon suppliers accountable for any future terrorist attacks, calling attention to how Beijing supplied the Taliban with weapons around the time of the Sept. 11 attacks.
TITLE=> Perspectives: How Coronavirus Fallout Will Impact US-China Relations. ARTICLE=> The effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on U.S.-China relations remain a point of great speculation, as trade, militarization and the global economy could possibly be destabilized or disrupted if relations between the nations sour further. Many right-rated voices frame China as the top offender in the coronavirus crisis, blaming Chinese leaders for hiding the severity of the virus and enabling a purportedly worsened global outbreak. Many left-rated voices have criticized anti-China rhetoric from President Trump and other Republican leaders, arguing that the White House is attempting to use China as a scapegoat for its own percieved shortcomings.
TITLE=> Conflicting Concerns Over Economy, Safety Shape Debate on Reopening. ARTICLE=> As the number of COVID-19 coronavirus cases in the U.S. tops 80,000, debates about reopening the country are being molded by concerns about public safety, a potential second wave of infections, and continued economic stagnancy. Many reports, especially from left- and center-rated outlets, cite concerns from scientists who warn that hasty reopenings could spell a drastic rise in the number of coronavirus cases; some concentrated on the apparent futility of searching for a universal indicator to signify when the country will be safe enough to reopen entirely. Other reports, particularly from right-rated outlets, focused on projections from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others that the severe economic disarray could worsen if careful reopenings are not initiated soon.
TITLE=> Afghan Refugees Set to Start New Lives in US. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration this week unveiled its plan for resetting the initial 37,000 Afghan refugees who recently arrived in the United States. Under the new Afghan Placement and Assistance (APA) Program, refugees will be resettled by state; California will receive the most (5,255), followed by Texas (4,481). At least ten other states will each resettle 1,000 more refugees. The U.S. completed its military withdrawal from Afghanistan on Aug. 31 but continues to evacuate U.S. residents and refugees alike amid the Taliban's return to power; more refugees will likely arrive and be resettled under APA. The initial resettlements will begin in several weeks after refugees undergo medical screening and immunizations at overseas military bases.  Voices on all sides have expressed support for welcoming refugees. Right-rated sources have focused more on how refugees will be vetted by immigration officials, and how the means for them to resettle stably will be provided and funded. Some highlighted residents of areas where refugee resettlements are planned who expressed concerns about the refugees and the vetting process.
TITLE=> Senate Rejects Bill, Government Shutdown Begins. ARTICLE=> Senators voted late Friday to reject a House-passed bill that would have funded the government until February 16. Although the voting did not fall completely along party lines, most Democrats voted against the bill in hopes of negotiation on "Dreamers," while many Republicans were making arguments related to child healthcare funding. Many on the Left are blaming the Trump administration and Republicans for the shutdown, while those on the Right blame Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
