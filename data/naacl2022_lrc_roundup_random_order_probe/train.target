TITLE=> Biden Team Considers Politically Diverse Cabinet Appointees. ARTICLE=> With the 2020 presidential election called for Joe Biden by most of the news media, attention has turned to the projected winner’s potential cabinet picks. While progressive groups Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement have urged Biden to appoint left-leaning progressives and to create a new climate change office, members of Biden's team have said that "Diversity of ideology and background is a core value of the transition." Biden’s picks will also be affected by the Senate, which may fall under Republican control after the Georgia runoff elections. Coverage was relatively balanced on all sides, with some coverage focusing on the cabinet recommendations of activist groups. Right-rated outlets were more likely to directly cover cabinet contenders if they had called the election for Biden.
TITLE=> Trump Administration Proposes Plan to Roll Back Clean Water Regulations. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration on Tuesday unveiled a plan to roll back Obama-era rules on clean water which placed many small waterways under federal regulation. Some say it is a victory against government overreach as well as a win for developers who felt the rules were too cumbersome. Others contend that it will negatively impact the quality of drinking water and will put wildlife at risk.
TITLE=> Trump Invites Congressional Leaders to White House for Border Security Meeting. ARTICLE=> President Trump has invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House for a meeting Wednesday on border security as the partial government shutdown continues over funding for a border wall.

ARTICLE=> After a shooting in Jersey City, New Jersey left a police officer and five civilians dead, officials are investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism. At least one of the two alleged shooters reportedly had ties to a Black Hebrew Israelite group, and had posted anti-police and anti-Semitic content online. The pair was armed with 'long rifles', according to witnesses. Most coverage has focused on the ties to Black Hebrew Israelites, possible evidence of terrorism and police reports that the attack was "targeted."
TITLE=> 20.5 Million Jobs Lost in April. ARTICLE=> According to the Department of Labor's monthly report, the United States lost approximately 20.5 million nonfarm jobs in the month of April as the economy reeled from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. This brings the U.S. unemployment rate to 14.7% percent, the highest since World War II. Some right-rated outlets pointed out that some workers supposedly make more from unemployment benefits than from their actual jobs due to new pandemic-era policies. Others noted predictions from some experts that say the economy may have already regained a few million of those jobs since April's end.
TITLE=> Parkland Students to Launch Gun Control Bus Tour. ARTICLE=> Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are launching a nationwide bus tour to increase voter registration, advocate for gun control, and campaign against the NRA.
TITLE=> Biden Administration to Send 4 Million Doses of AstraZeneca Vaccine to Canada and Mexico. ARTICLE=> The Biden Administration is finalizing plans to loan 4 million surplus doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to Canada and Mexico, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Thursday. This would be the first time the U.S. directly shared vaccines with another country. “Our first priority remains vaccinating the U.S. population, but the reality is the pandemic knows no borders,” Psaki said. Reuters and the Washington Post first reported the story earlier that day via anonymous administration sources. The Biden administration currently has about 7 million doses of the vaccine, but the FDA has not yet authorized its use. The U.S. is currently administering over 2.4 million vaccine doses daily, with 22.2% of Americans having received at least one dose. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with left- and center-rated outlets publishing articles earlier than right-rated outlets. Coverage in some left-rated outlets linked the move to "vaccine diplomacy." Some coverage from both the right and the left addressed speculation that the deal was a part of negotiations with Mexico on managing a growing number of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Charges Against Trump Organization. ARTICLE=> The Trump Organization has been charged with 15 counts of tax fraud and other crimes by New York prosecutors. The Manhattan district attorney's office unsealed an indictment Thursday that detailed charges against the organization for attempting to compensate "Trump Organization executives in a manner that was 'off the books.'" Chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg was the indictment's focus, and is accused of tax evasion on $1.76 million in income dating back to 2005. It's the first criminal case against Trump's company; the former president himself was not charged with any wrongdoing, and accused prosecutors of leading a "witch hunt." 	Voices across the spectrum analyzed how the charges may impact Trump. Legal experts, regardless of potential ideological bias, have drawn different conclusions. Some say New York's continued probes could likely lead to charges against him due to his close ties with the organization; others doubt that scenario, saying the lack of charges against Trump to this point means a future charge "appears increasingly unlikely." Many right-rated voices have accused New York prosecutors of pursuing Trump for politically-motivated reasons, and have framed the charges against the Trump Organization as weak and unlikely to amount to any legitimate legal consequences for the former president.
TITLE=> Filibuster Against Gorsuch. ARTICLE=> Jeff Merkley spoke overnight to filibuster the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
TITLE=> Paul Manafort Found Guilty on Eight Counts of Bank and Tax Fraud. ARTICLE=> Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, was convicted on Tuesday on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, with the judge declaring a mistrial on the ten remaining charges. Some on the Left have said that the verdict is legally troublesome for Trump, particularly as Manafort enters his second trial in the District of Columbia, while others on the Right claim that Manafort's conviction does nothing to show that the president colluded with Russia.
TITLE=> Leaked Interviews with Navy SEALs Paint Dark Picture of Eddie Gallagher. ARTICLE=> In a series of leaked Navy investigative interviews released as part of an in-depth New York Times report published Friday, members of Chief Petty Office Eddie Gallagher's Navy SEAL platoon described his actions in the line of duty as violent and immoral. An attorney for Gallagher told CBS News that his client is preparing to sue the Times, saying the article is "false and misleading"; Gallagher was acquitted of war crimes in July, but was convicted of posing for a photo with a war prisoner's corpse. Left-rated outlets generally focused reporting on Gallagher's connections to President Donald Trump more so than right-rated outlets; Trump formally pardoned Gallagher in November and has spoken out in support of him.
TITLE=> FBI Links Pensacola Military Base Shooter to Al-Qaida. ARTICLE=> The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced Monday that it found a link between the al-Qaida extremist group and the rogue Saudi Air Force cadet who murdered three U.S. sailors at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida last December. Several weeks after the shooting, Attorney General William Barr said the attack was driven by "jihadist ideologies." The FBI, which has yet to call the shooting an act of terrorism, reportedly found the link after unlocking the shooter's cell phones. Central to many reports was Apple's involvement in the case; the tech giant originally resisted breaking with privacy protocols to unlock the shooter's phones for federal investigators. Right-rated outlets were more likely to frame Apple's handling of the situation in a more negative light; some also referred to the assailant a "mass shooter."
TITLE=> Trump to Meet with Putin. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump is scheduled to have a sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in Hamburg today. The two met briefly and shook hands in the morning.
TITLE=> Hackers Behind Kaseya Ransomware Attack Demand $70 Million in Bitcoin. ARTICLE=> Russian-linked cybercrime group REvil reportedly demanded $70 million in Bitcoin on Monday to restore data targeted in a massive ransomware attack. The attack was launched on Friday against Kaseya, a Miami-based software provider, using its IT management software to spread to thousands of connected systems in at least 17 countries. The ransom demand was posted on REvil’s dark web site Happy Blog, leading experts to conclude that the group was behind the attack. REvil was also behind the ransomware attack against meatpacking company JBS, which resulted in an $11 million payment. President Joe Biden said Saturday that he had ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate the attack. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Coverage differed across the spectrum in its descriptions of REvil, which included “cybercrime gang,” “the notorious REvil gang,” and “Russian-linked hackers.”

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Impact of the Israel-UAE Agreement. ARTICLE=> In their announcement of the “Abraham Accords”, leaders from Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States praised the deal, with President Donald Trump calling it a “historic peace agreement.” The agreement included normalizing Israel-UAE relations and temporarily ending Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank. Outlets on all sides published opinions on the agreement. Voices covered by right-rated outlets tended to portray the agreement as a victory for Trump and a step toward peace in the Middle East. Voices covered by left- and center-rated outlets were mixed, diverging on the deal’s impact on Trump, Palestinians and future regional stability.
TITLE=> PA Lawmaker Proposes Banning Certain Political Discussions From Classroom. ARTICLE=> A Pennsylvania state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would ban public schoolteachers from discussing many modern-day political matters in the classroom and prohibit them from endorsing, supporting, or opposing any candidate running for office.

Nancy Pelosi is old," he said.
TITLE=> Climate Change Activists Take Field at Harvard-Yale Football Game. ARTICLE=> The annual Thanksgiving week football game between Harvard and Yale Universities this past Saturday in New Haven, Conn. saw activists and protesters storm the field at halftime, calling on the schools to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies. 42 people were charged with disorderly conduct in connection with the demonstration; the student groups behind the protest released a statement following the game. Most reports, regardless of political leaning, provided detailed context about the schools' financial connections to fossil fuel companies; some right-leaning voices criticized protesters for "hurting the credibility" of the discussion around climate change.
TITLE=> Saudi Arabia Sentences Five to Death for Murder of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi. ARTICLE=> Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor announced Monday that five people had been sentenced to death for the October 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi was a Washington Post columnist and native Saudi Arabian whose work was often critical of the Saudi government; he was allegedly set up by the Saudi government and killed at the consulate by government agents. Most reporting focused on the fact that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and members of his inner circle were cleared of wrongdoing in the killing, despite CIA intelligence which found that bin Salman personally ordered the assassination.
TITLE=> Travel Ban Goes Into Effect. ARTICLE=> President Trump's travel order will begin to go into effect Thursday, just a few days after the Supreme Court upheld parts of the controversial policy, which temporarily bars visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries.

Jim Jordan has been accused by seven former wrestlers of ignoring claims of sexual abuse at the hands of a team doctor at Ohio State University when Jordan was an assistant wrestling coach at the school.
TITLE=> Biden HHS Restores Trans Health Protections in Reversal of Trump Policy. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration will reverse Trump-era rules excluding transgender people from the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination protections, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Monday. Specifically, HHS will interpret Section 1557 of the ACA, which prevents healthcare discrimination on the basis of “race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability,” to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This reflects a 2020 Supreme Court ruling, which held that the Civil Rights Act of 1964's "sex" protections included sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration previously limited Section 1557 protections to a person’s biological sex in June 2020. The Obama administration included abortion and trans people under Section 1557 in 2016, but a federal judge overturned the policy in 2019. Coverage from right-rated outlets was relatively rare and focused more on the Trump policy of allowing providers to refuse abortions. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets tended to say the announcement "reversed" the Trump policy, with some coverage from the left attributing the new policy directly to President Joe Biden and calling the Trump policy "anti-transgender."
TITLE=> Reporter Resigns From New York Post Following Story Claiming Harris Book Was Given To Migrant Children. ARTICLE=> Laura Italiano, a former reporter for the New York Post, said in a tweet Tuesday she resigned after being “ordered” to write an "incorrect" story. On Saturday, the New York Post published an article claiming that Vice President Kamala Harris' 2019 book, “Superheroes Are Everywhere,” was being distributed at migrant shelters; Italiano's byline appeared on the story. The story prompted wide criticism of Harris from the right. On Tuesday, the story was updated "to note that only one known copy of the book was given to a child." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services clarified to Newsweek Tuesday that the book was donated as a part of an effort in the city of Long Beach, California, to collect books and toys as donations for the children being detained in that city, and that taxpayer dollars were not used to purchase Harris' book.  Following the original stories, some on the right questioned whether Harris was profiting from the books being distributed. Italiano's resignation and the Post's update received wide coverage from left and center-rated outlets, who pointed to the story as an instance of partisan media jumping on a story that would paint the other side in a bad light.
TITLE=> NK Says it has Right to Shoot US Bombers. ARTICLE=> Today, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters outside the United Nations in New York that, "since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to ... shoot down United States strategic bombers." This statement came after a week of General Assembly meetings in New York in which Ri made a speech that referred to President Trump as a "mentally deranged person full of megalomania." Trump responded to the speech with a tweet that said the foreign minister and Kim Jong-un "won't be around much longer."
TITLE=> Amid Insider Trading Probe, Burr to Step Down from Intelligence Committee. ARTICLE=> Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) is set to step down as the Senate Intelligence Committee chairperson, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced Thursday morning. This comes after Burr's Washington D.C. office was served a search warrant by the FBI Wednesday in relation to investigations of COVID-19 coronavirus-related insider trading allegations brought against Burr and several other senators. Burr is said to have unloaded between $628,000 and $1.7 million worth of stocks and shares in 33 separate transactions on February 13, shortly before the stock market's sharp decline. In 2016, Senator Burr announced that he would not be seeking reelection in 2022; he has spent the past three years overseeing the Intelligence Committee's investigation into possible Russian election interference.
TITLE=> Whistleblower Says DHS Downplayed Threats from Russia and White Supremacists to Help Trump. ARTICLE=> A whistleblower complaint alleges that top officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security downplayed threats from white supremacists and Russian election interference while altering reports to support Trump’s claims. The DHS and the White House denied the allegations. The whistleblower is Brian Murphy, a former official at the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, who says he was removed from his position because he refused to cooperate. Murphy also claimed that acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf twice asked him to stop providing assessments on Russian interference because “it made the president look bad.” Coverage in outlets on all sides was comprehensive, discussing the allegations, their release by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, and the denials made by senior officials. Some coverage in right-rated outlets placed more emphasis on the denials and Schiff's involvement. Some coverage in left-rated outlets focused on the allegations' purported seriousness.
TITLE=> Democrats Set to Advance Pandemic Relief Bill as Congress Approves Budget. ARTICLE=> The House voted 219-209 Friday to approve a budget resolution that will help advance the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. The Senate voted 51-50 early Friday morning to pass the measure; Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote. The moves are a part of the budget reconciliation process, which allows lawmakers to approve and advance budget-related legislation by a simple majority rather than with the 60 Senate votes usually needed. Some left-rated sources highlighted Harris making her first tie-breaking vote in the Senate, and the dozens of other measures voted on during the Senate's all-night session. Many reports from right-rated sources focused on how budget reconciliation will overrule dissent from Republicans, and on President Biden's willingness to move forward without Republican support.
TITLE=> Trump Tax Plan. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Wednesday plans to call for a significant increase in the standard deduction people can claim on their tax returns, potentially putting thousands of dollars each year into the pockets of tens of millions of Americans, according to two people briefed on the plan.
TITLE=> Biden Says Black Voters "Ain't Black" if Considering Trump Over Him. ARTICLE=> In an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show Friday morning, presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden sparked controversy with comments about black voters. When host Charlamagne tha God told Biden he'd like to have him back on for "more questions" in the future, Biden responded; "Well, I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black." Biden later apologized, saying he "shouldn't have been such a wise guy." The issue has been covered widely by media outlets on all sides of the political spectrum, especially right-rated outlets. Some right-rated voices focused on allegations from the Trump campaign and African-American Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) that Biden's remarks were "racist." Updated 5/22/20 at 8:57 p.m. ET
TITLE=> 2 Dead as Kenosha Unrest Turns Violent; Media Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> Two people were killed and one was injured by gunfire in Kenosha, Wisconsin Tuesday night amid protests and violence. People set fire to buildings and cars, and at times clashed with law enforcement, following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in the city on Sunday. The shooting and its aftermath continue to command national news coverage. Some coverage in left- and center-rated outlets focused on reports that the alleged shooter walked past police without being apprehended. Some coverage in right-rated outlets highlighted the governor's refusal of the White House's offer to add 500 additional National Guard troops to the current force of 250. Many left- and center-rated outlets’ coverage described the shooting as "during a protest", with significant coverage on social repercussions and Blake's current condition. Most right-rated outlets’ coverage described the events as violent and destructive “riots."

TITLE=> FDA Authorizes, CDC Recommends Additional Vaccine Dose for Certain Immunocompromised People. ARTICLE=> Following the FDA’s expanded emergency use authorization and a CDC advisory board’s recommendation, the CDC officially said Friday that certain immunocompromised people should get a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the Delta variant. The recommendation is specifically aimed at “moderately to severely” immunocompromised people, including cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, people with advanced HIV infection, and more. “At a time when the Delta variant is surging, an additional vaccine dose for some people with weakened immune systems could help prevent serious and possibly life-threatening COVID-19 cases within this population,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement released Friday.  Coverage was widespread and mostly balanced across the spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to feature the story prominently on homepages on Friday evening. 
TITLE=> April 2018 Jobs Report. ARTICLE=> In April, the U.S. added 164,000 jobs, falling short of the projected 195,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.9%, which is the lowest the country has seen since 2000.

Her supporters argue that the San Francisco liberal, who served as speaker from 2007 to 2011, has the necessary experience and fundraising power to accomplish the Democrats' legislative agenda.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Where do Americans Really Stand On 'Abolish the Police'?. ARTICLE=> After George Floyd was killed by a police officer in May, many liberal activists have called to defund or abolish the police, claiming the criminal justice system is inherently racist. But where do most Americans really stand on the "Abolish the Police" movement? In Seattle, the police precinct for the Capitol Hill neighborhood was disbanded as protestors occupied the zone for nearly a month of protests. Now, a group of local businesses owners from the Capitol Hill neighborhood is suing the city for property damage and lost revenue during the occupation. A recent Gallup poll revealed that 61 percent of black Americans want police presence to remain the same, with 67 percent of respondents preferring police presence to remain the same; it is important to note that the Gallup poll only included adults. Some media outlets with young adult audiences promote abolition of police, prisons and federal crime units, suggesting that the young people may end up taking a more progressive stance on criminal justice than the previous generation. The Seattle lawsuit and Gallup poll results have both been covered by outlets from all sides of the political spectrum. Voices from the right said the Gallup poll proves that the majority opinion was not represented in liberal media's “national conversation” about race and policing. Many voices from the left advocated for government funding to be reallocated from police budgets and used to address purported root causes of crime, such as unemployment and class inequality.
TITLE=> Official US Coronavirus Death Toll Now Over 100,000. ARTICLE=> The official United States death toll from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic surpassed 100,000 on Wednesday. The milestone incited a wave of media coverage, reactions and reflections on the extent of the pandemic in the U.S. over the past four months. Many reports compared the death toll to that of other historical disasters and armed conflicts. Some left-rated coverage framed the milestone as a blow to President Donald Trump, who's accused of downplaying the virus and purportedly leaving the nation unprepared. Some right-rated coverage looked more at specifics of the death toll, such as the hardest-hit communities and various supposed policy failures that led to otherwise preventable deaths.
TITLE=> Afghanistan Government Collapses As Taliban Fighters Conquer Kabul. ARTICLE=> The Taliban has regained control of Afghanistan's government after being removed from power by the United States two decades ago. The militant organization seized the nation's capital, Kabul, on Sunday while facing little resistance from government forces. After pledging to “prevent further instability” during a national address on Saturday, President Ashraf Ghani fled the country shortly after the Taliban fighters entered the capital. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that a council would be formed to "prevent chaos" and better manage the transition; two Taliban officials told Reuters on Sunday morning there would be no transitional government in Afghanistan and that the group expects a complete handover of power. Another spokesman told Al-Jazeera Mubasher TV that the war is over in Afghanistan and that the type of regime to be established will be revealed soon.  Coverage of Kabul's fall and Ghani's exit was prominently featured by most major news outlets across the spectrum. Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight Trump's criticism of Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal strategy as well as Biden's "vacation" at Camp David.
TITLE=> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Proposals to Ban ‘Vaccine Passports,' Fire Dr. Fauci. ARTICLE=> Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced several proposals on Thursday, including one to ban "vaccine passports" by prohibiting businesses from refusing service to people who are unvaccinated, and one to eliminate the salary of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) chief Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, according to Forbes, made $434,312 last year and is one of the highest paid federal employees. The “Fire Fauci Act” would also launch a probe to determine "how the agency responded to the virus," while the "We Will Not Comply Act,” includes a “cut off federal funding for a vaccine mandate” on certain groups, including federal employees, students and those with religious objections, and bans travel restrictions for the unvaccinated. This comes after Greene was removed from her committee assignments in February. Media outlets from across the political spectrum have speculated about the likelihood of these bills to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives; outlets on all sides have said it is unlikely to pass. Some right-rated outlets focused on Greene's vaccine passport bill, and pointed out that Greene's concerns about privacy are shared by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Some voices from the left heavily criticized Greene and made it clear they did not take her bills seriously.
TITLE=> Postmaster General Addresses Mail Concerns in Senate Hearing. ARTICLE=> Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before Congress on Friday, assuring concerned senators that “the Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation’s election mail fully and on time.” DeJoy also said he would not undo recent policy changes, such as cutting budgets, removing some mailboxes, shutting down sorting equipment and limiting overtime hours for mail carriers. The same day, six states sued DeJoy and the Postal Service, arguing that these recent changes caused widespread mail delays and threatened vote-by-mail in the upcoming election.
TITLE=> Hunter Biden Defends Work For Foreign Companies. ARTICLE=> In an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden defended the ethical implications of his business ventures in Ukraine and China.

TITLE=> Senate Overrides Trump's Defense Bill Veto. ARTICLE=> The Senate voted 81-13 to override President Donald Trump’s veto of the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act on Friday. This comes after the House voted 322-87 Monday to override Trump's veto. The bill includes funding for military programs, construction projects, a 3% pay raise for military, and renaming of military bases named for Confederate generals. Trump vetoed the defense bill last week for its potential to restrict the president's ability to withdraw troops, and because it excludes a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This marks Congress' first veto override of Trump's administration; the president has vetoed nine bills during his presidency. Some left- and center-rated outlets highlighted this story as an example of the divide between Congress and the president over defense and security legislation. Some right-rated outlets tended to focus on Trump's objections and the contents of the bill.
TITLE=> Biden Sets Target of Cutting US Emissions up to 52% by 2030. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, President Joe Biden will commit the United States to cutting its greenhouse emissions 50% to 52% by 2030 in remarks kicking off his climate summit event with world leaders.  The target, aimed at slowing climate change, is non-binding unless approved by Congress. Yet Biden hopes it pushes other countries to submit more ambitious plans to the United Nations as part of the Paris Agreement, which former President Donald Trump rejected. Before the announcement, environmental activists said a target of around 50% wasn’t ambitious enough.  Conservatives said trying to meet it will sap the U.S. economy with no guarantees that other countries will follow through on their own pledges, since some fear a negative impact on their own economic growth.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Blocks Questioning of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court blocked a deposition of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. The Court ruled that Ross cannot be questioned in a lawsuit challenging a planned question in the 2020 census.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Record Quarterly Drop in GDP Drives Economic Speculation, Stimulus Talks. ARTICLE=> U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) dropped at an annual rate of 32.9% in the second quarter of 2020, the largest such drop on record. Speculation soon followed about how the fall could impact the country's economic rebound from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and in a more immediate sense, could impact the November presidential election and ongoing negotiations between lawmakers about a potential new virus relief package. Some left-rated voices tied the numbers to President Trump's recent remarks about a possible election delay, framing his comments as an effort to distract voters from negative economic data. Some right-rated voices used the data to offer a look ahead at how the U.S. economic recovery will pan out, mentioning that some major industries such as construction and manufacturing are beginning to resume operations. Coverage on all sides of the spectrum noted the data's historic significance. Editor's Note: this post originally described the 32.9% drop as a quarterly rate, rather than the annual rate. We regret the error. Updated 7/30/20 at 8:53 p.m. ET
TITLE=> Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 50 Years Later. ARTICLE=> On the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, his legacy was both revered and debated.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Ongoing Global Semiconductor Chip Shortage. ARTICLE=> A global shortage of semiconductor computer chips has impacted industries around the world, causing supply chain delays for everything from cars to smartphones and gaming consoles. On Wednesday, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that supply constraints would limit sales of iPads and Macs, cutting the company’s revenue by $3 billion to $4 billion over the next three months. While the Biden administration has taken steps to address the shortage, including holding a summit with tech CEOs earlier this month, some manufacturers have warned that the shortage could last until 2022.  Perspectives mostly came from business-focused outlets. Voices in some right-rated outlets argued against U.S. government involvement to address the shortage; voices in left-rated outlets tended to feature “why you should care”-style analysis.

TITLE=> Manchin Doubles Down on $1.5 Trillion Limit for Democrats' Budget Reconciliation Bill. ARTICLE=> West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin doubled down Thursday on a $1.5 trillion maximum for Democrats’ budget reconciliation bill, which was previously expected to spend $3.5 trillion over the next ten years. Manchin called the $3.5 trillion figure “fiscal insanity” in a Wednesday statement, arguing that “we can’t even pay for the essential social programs, like Social Security and Medicare.” On Thursday, a leaked memo revealed that Manchin had proposed a deal to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in July to limit the bill to $1.5 trillion. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema also reiterated her opposition to a $3.5 trillion figure on Thursday. Manchin and Sinema’s statements sparked renewed criticism from other Democrats, some of whom reiterated threats to block the bipartisan infrastructure bill unless progress was made on the budget reconciliation bill. In the face of unanimous Republican opposition, Democrats need Manchin and Sinema’s votes to pass any version of their budget bill.  Coverage of Manchin, Sinema, and Democratic infighting dominated news outlets across the spectrum on Thursday. Some coverage across the spectrum used sensational words like “sweeping” to describe the budget reconciliation bill, with some right-rated outlets emphasizing its size through words like “astronomical.”
TITLE=> Senate Judiciary Committee Advances Barrett Nomination over Democratic Boycott. ARTICLE=> Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-0 to advance Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination to the full Senate. The committee’s ten Democratic members boycotted the vote by refusing to attend the committee hearing. Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham moved forward without the Democrats, despite committee rules requiring at least two members of the minority to be present for a vote. Graham instead followed broader Senate rules only requiring a simple majority of committee members for a vote. A full Senate vote on Barrett’s nomination is expected Monday. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to refer to the boycott as “symbolic” and to include that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been confirmed this close to a presidential election. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to say that the committee voted “unanimously” to move forward with confirmation.
TITLE=> Sessions Sues California Over Sanctuary City Policies. ARTICLE=> Jeff Sessions is suing California over its sanctuary city policies that protect illegal immigrants from deportation, sparking a debate on if local authorities should enforce federal law over state law. He took particular issue with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off an immigrant community about an impending ICE raid.
TITLE=> Trump Threatens to Move RNC Out of North Carolina. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump threatened Monday to pull the Republican National Convention (RNC) out of Charlotte, North Carolina, over a dispute with Gov. Roy Cooper (D) about possibly limiting attendance due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Each major party holds a convention every four summers to determine its presidential nominee; this year's RNC is scheduled for August 24-27. Some left- and center-rated voices framed the president's threats as an example of his supposed obsession with popularity and disregard for public health concerns. Some right-rated outlets framed Cooper's caution as exaggerated, and lockdowns and stay-at-home orders as a political strategy to undermine Trump's reelection chances. Some right-rated sources reiterated a New York Times report that the pandemic is hitting Democratic-run states the hardest.
TITLE=> President Trump Threatens Government Shutdown Over Border Wall Funding. ARTICLE=> President Trump reportedly told several GOP senators and White House officials that he will shut down the government in September if Congress does not provide him with $25 billion for a border wall.
TITLE=> Calls For Schools To Reopen Grow As Studies Find COVID-19 Transmission Rate Low Among Children, Teachers Get Vaccinated. ARTICLE=> Calls to reopen schools grow as teachers receive the COVID-19 vaccine and studies show a low virus transmission rate among young children. A study from the American Academy of Pediatrics found in-school transmission of COVID-19 to be "extremely rare," while a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) report found that COVID-19 cases among children remained low even after schools reopened in-person learning. Other state leaders promise to provide vaccines for teachers if in-person learning is resumed; Ohio's governor offered to vaccinate teachers in February if their school districts agree to resume partial in-person schooling by the beginning of March. Arizona's teachers are already receiving vaccines this month and are expected to resume in-person teaching shortly, despite the state reaching its highest virus diagnosis rate in the past week. These calls come as the U.S. recorded an all-time high of 4,327 COVID-related deaths on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Voices from across the political spectrum are analyzing the likelihood of schools reopening after teachers get vaccinated; the studies were highlighted by both left- and right-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Attack at British Parliament. ARTICLE=> Members of the House of Commons found themselves under lockdown on Wednesday afternoon after reports of a shooting outside the British Parliament.
TITLE=> Biden, Democrats Urge Gun Control Legislation After Colorado Mass Shooting. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden urged the Senate to pass gun control legislation, including an assault weapons ban, in a Tuesday address following a mass shooting at a Boulder, Colorado grocery store that left 10 dead. The president is also considering taking executive action on the matter, according to the White House. “The Senate is going to debate and address the epidemic of gun violence in this country,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier that day. The House passed two bills in early March that would expand background checks and close loopholes for gun sales and transfers. In 1994, then-Senator Biden helped pass a federal assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later. Coverage in some right-rated outlets placed more emphasis on Biden's call for an assault weapons ban. Coverage in some left-rated outlets mentioned that Senate Democrats would need at least 10 Republican votes to pass gun legislation because of the filibuster.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rejects Exxon Appeal in Climate Change Case.

TITLE=> Celebrating Black History Month. ARTICLE=> February is Black History Month, dedicated to celebrating African Americans' cultural heritage and achievements throughout history, while recognizing the ongoing struggle for racial justice. The Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) said this year the theme for Black History Month is "The Black Family: Representation, Identity and Diversity." Historian Carter G. Woodson established the precursor to Black History Month in 1926 by dedicating a week; in 1976, former President Gerald Ford expanded the week into Black History Month. Many have utilized Black History Month to call for racial justice and to continue to speak about the events black communities in the U.S. have faced in the past year, including deaths and job losses from COVID-19, police brutality and the killing of George Floyd, which prompted nationwide protests and the spread of the Black Lives Matter Movement. While cities and communities typically host events throughout the month to celebrate, the COVID-19 pandemic caused most of the celebrations to become virtual this year. Outlets from across the political spectrum are covering Black History Month. Right- and center-rated outlets tended to detail the history of Black History Month, as well as the issues the black community continues to face; some center-rated outlets used the holiday to call for the nation to move forward in unity. Some voices from the left continued to use the month to call for racial justice, while other left-rated outlets are publishing a series of articles throughout the month focusing on different aspects of the black community and black history.

TITLE=> 1619 Project Creator Nikole Hannah-Jones Rejects UNC Tenure Offer, Joins Howard University. ARTICLE=> Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of The New York Times Magazine’s 1619 Project, has declined a tenured position at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will instead join Howard University as the Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism, a new tenured position. UNC, Hannah-Jones’ alma mater, initially attempted to offer her a traditionally tenured position as Knight Chair but lowered its offer to a five-year contract following opposition from conservative critics and Walter Hussman, a major donor and the journalism school's namesake. UNC later renewed its tenure offer on June 30. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Hannah-Jones said she had been treated “shabbily” by UNC, explaining, “The Knight chairs are designed for professional journalists when working in the field, to come into academia. Every other chair before me, who also happened to be white, received that position with tenure.” Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., also announced the hiring of writer and Howard alumnus Ta-Nehisi Coates.  Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to mention that Hannah-Jones won a Pulitzer Prize for her work on The 1619 Project. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to describe conservatives’ criticisms as “concerns” and The 1619 Project as “controversial.”
TITLE=> Shutdown Set to Become Longest in History as House Votes to Reopen Interior Department, EPA.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Tucker Carlson Visits Hungary. ARTICLE=> Fox News host Tucker Carlson announced Monday that the next week of his highly-watched show would be broadcast from Hungary. The trip began with a Monday meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for his conservative nationalist politics and whose party recently passed a controversial law banning media that "promotes" LGBTQ identities from schools. “If you care about western civilization and democracy and families and the ferocious assault on all three of those things by the leaders of our global institutions, you should know what is happening [in Hungary] right now,” Carlson said in his opening monologue on Monday.  Carlson will also reportedly give a speech titled “The World According to Tucker Carlson” at MCC Feszt, an academic conference in Budapest, Hungary at Mathias Corvinus Collegium, an elite school to which Orbán recently funneled $1.7 billion in government funds. PragerU founder Dennis Prager is also scheduled to speak at the event on Aug. 6.  Voices in left-rated outlets tended to frame Carlson’s visit to Hungary negatively, calling Orbán an “authoritarian.” They also described MCC Feszt as a “far-right conference,” echoing Hungarian critics who have said that Orbán wants the school to foster a conservative elite. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to criticize left-leaning commentators, arguing that MCC Feszt was not "far-right" and that Hungary’s policies under Orbán were either a model for American conservatives or just not as noteworthy as foreign commentators alleged.
TITLE=> Iranians Protest For Downed Ukrainian Plane. ARTICLE=> Iranian security forces fired live ammunition and tear gas at demonstrators protesting against Iran's initial denial that it shot down a Ukrainian plane.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Booster Shot Plan. ARTICLE=> President Biden announced in August that his administration would begin offering a third “booster” shot to Americans eight months after their second dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine starting on Sept. 20. Since the FDA has already authorized certain immunocompromised people to get their third dose, Biden's plan prioritizes older people and health care workers. Many leading health officials have been apprehensive about the White House's premature decision to weigh in on unproven COVID-19 treatments. On Thursday, the respective leaders of the FDA and CDC told White House pandemic coordinator Jeffrey Zients that they might only be able to approve the vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech for "a subset of non-immunocompromised people" in the next several weeks. The U.S. is still waiting for data from other countries around the world like Israel, which began promoting booster shots for individuals 12 and older on Aug. 29. The majority of voices across the spectrum seemed to agree that the Biden administration has put pressure on the FDA to approve booster shots. Left-rated outlets, which have generally been more critical of Biden since his Afghanistan "debacle," were more likely to take the stance that COVID-19 vaccines and subsequent boosters provide "extraordinary protection" against serious illness or death. Some right-rated outlets highlighted how shifting the public's attention towards booster shots "may send the wrong message about vaccines."
TITLE=> Markets Show Positive Signs Amid Vaccine Development, Stimulus Push. ARTICLE=> All three major stock indices experienced solid growth on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, the NASDAQ Composite climbed 0.5%, and the S&P 500 gained 0.3%; both the NASDAQ and S&P also set new record-highs. Reports suggest that specific types of investments such as hedge funds are also currently setting records for high returns. Many attributed the positive market activity to public optimism about COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine development, the 2020 presidential election results, and ongoing legislative discussions about distributing more federal pandemic relief. The news wasn't covered particularly prominently throughout the spectrum; less reporting overall came from right-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Day 3 of Government Shutdown. ARTICLE=> President Trump blames Democrats as they reject a last-minute deal to reopen the government on Sunday night. Now, both Republicans and Democrats are weighing risks and rewards ahead of a vote at noon today.

TITLE=> Doctor Testifies George Floyd Died From Lack of Oxygen. ARTICLE=> Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist called as a prosecution witness in Derek Chauvin's murder trial, testified on Thursday that George Floyd died from a lack of oxygen caused by being handcuffed face down in the street with the former Minneapolis police officer's knee on his neck. Chauvin's defense team has maintained that Floyd was addicted to narcotics and that he ingested fentanyl, a substance the team said contributed to his death. Tobin testified as Chauvin's trial enters a new technical phase, with prosecutors expected to call a string of medical experts to testify about how Floyd died in police custody. Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges.
TITLE=> New CA Law Will Require Trump's Tax Returns for 2020 Eligibility. ARTICLE=> A new California law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday will require all presidential candidates to disclose the last five years of their tax returns in order to be eligible for placement on the state's 2020 election ballot. Most outlets reported that the law was directly targeted at President Donald Trump, whose tax returns are not public. Some on the left focused on ongoing efforts at both the federal and state level to force Trump to release his returns; many on the right focused on Republican claims that the law is unconstitutional and will not survive a legal challenge.
TITLE=> Senate Releases Russia Report; Media Interpretations Differ. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released its Russia interference report. The 966-page report was a bipartisan investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election. The Senate panel found no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election, though it did find a list of contacts made between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials; some of these contacts were allegedly made through Konstantin Kilimnik, a former associate of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s, who was named a “Russian intelligence officer” by the report. The Senate committee also heavily criticized the FBI’s vetting of former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele's opposition research file against Trump, saying the bureau's handling of the dossier “lacked rigor and transparency.”  Some coverage from right-rated outlets acknowledged the report painted Trump in a bad light, while other coverage from the right focused on the purported lack of evidence of collusion and the criticism of the FBI's handling of the Steele dossier. Coverage from left-rated outlets primarily focused on how the report ostensibly contradicted Trump's stance on the Russia investigation; some also highlighted Paul Manafort's alleged connections to Russian intelligence officers.
TITLE=> At Least 13 US Troops, Over 100 Afghans Killed in Suicide Bombing Near Kabul Airport. ARTICLE=> Islamic terrorists attacked crowds of people near the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan Thursday, in a suicide bombing and gunfire that killed nearly 200 people and wounded at least 140 more. Among the dead are 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans; it's the deadliest incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2011. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. and other nations had warned of possible terrorist attacks near the airport due to threats from Islamic militants. The Pentagon has blamed Islamic terror groups for the attacks; the Islamic State claimed responsibility Thursday afternoon. The airport is the epicenter of a massive evacuation effort as thousands flee the country amid the Taliban's return to power. On Thursday evening, President Joe Biden promised retaliation against ISIS-K, the regional affiliate of the Islamic State responsible for the attack, saying, “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.” Biden added that this retaliation would not interfere with the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline. On Friday, military officials said that only one explosion happened near the airport Thursday; two separate explosions were initially reported by sources across the spectrum. Countries including the U.S. are racing to evacuate their citizens and allies, many with limited means of escape, from Afghanistan before the Aug. 31 deadline. Updated 8/27/21 at 8:32 a.m. ET with the Pentagon's clarification. 
TITLE=> White House Revokes CNN Reporter Jim Acosta's Press Credentials After Testy Exchange With Trump. ARTICLE=> White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced that CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press credentials will be suspended until further notice after he engaged in a contentious exchange with President Trump, refusing to relinquish the microphone at a press conference and shouting questions over other reporters. Sanders tweeted a video that appears to be doctored, showing Acosta pushing the female staffer's arm as she tries to retrieve the mic, which he denies happened.
TITLE=> Don Jr. Appears on Hannity. ARTICLE=> Donald Trump Jr. appeared on Hannity to address the recent reports that he met with a Russian lawyer during the presidential campaign in order to collect damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

TITLE=> Barack Obama Criticizes Trump at the Democratic National Convention. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday night, former President Barack Obama criticized President Donald Trump during a speech at the Democratic National Convention. In his remarks, Obama called Trump unfit for office, and said democracy was at risk if the nation does not elect Joe Biden as President In November.
TITLE=> Trump Criticizes Fauci in Campaign Call. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump strongly criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci in a Monday morning campaign call, saying "people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.” He continued: "Every time he goes on television there's always a bomb, but there's a bigger bomb if you fire him. This guy's a disaster." Trump and Fauci’s messaging on the COVID-19 pandemic has diverged over the year, with Fauci telling CBS News that he was “absolutely not” surprised the president caught the virus. Fauci also raised concerns on Monday of “disturbingly anti-science” times "in certain segments of our society." Left- and center-rated outlets covered Trump’s criticism of Fauci more than right-rated outlets, with outlets on all sides covering Fauci’s comments on Trump catching the virus. Coverage in some left- and center-rated outlets used sensationalist language like “trashed” and blasted.”
TITLE=> Sessions Appears Before the House. ARTICLE=> Attorney General Jeff Sessions is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee this morning and is expected to face questions about a possible Justice Department probe into the Clinton Foundation and the ongoing Russian influence investigation.
TITLE=> Matt Gaetz Speaks Out Against Sexual Misconduct Allegations. ARTICLE=> On Friday, Florida representative Matt Gaetz spoke out against allegations of sexual misconduct. Speaking from the Save America Summit at former President Donald Trump’s Doral golf club in Miami, Gaetz said, “I have not yet begun to fight.” Gaetz currently faces a federal investigation into whether he violated sex trafficking laws and had a sexual relationship with a minor. ​The New York Times reported Thursday that investigators also believe Gaetz was involved with multiple women who were recruited online for sex and received cash payments. Gaetz has denied the claims, calling the allegations a "smear campaign." This comes after Gaetz reportedly asked the Trump administration for blanket preemptive pardons for himself and congressional allies; Gaetz was under investigation by the Department of Justice for sex trafficking at the time. On Friday, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger became the first GOP member to call for Gaetz's resignation. Coverage from the right tended to focus on Gaetz' defense against the claims during his Friday speech while center- and left-rated outlets tended to focus on the allegations against him. Some voices from the left likened Gaetz' defensive attitude to Trump's past approach to scandal.
TITLE=> Biden Holds First Press Conference as President. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden held his first press conference as president on Thursday, discussing a wide variety of issues including immigration, the Senate filibuster and foreign policy. In his opening remarks, Biden set a new goal of administering 200 million vaccine doses by his 100th day in office. While the last 15 presidents held at least one press conference by their 33rd day in office, Biden waited until his 64th day, longer than any president in the last 100 years. Coverage from across the spectrum focused on particular points made by Biden, such as the new vaccine goal. Coverage in right-rated outlets generally framed Biden's remarks more critically than coverage in left-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Military Tensions Flare Between China and Taiwan. ARTICLE=> Taiwan's defense minister says that tensions between Taipei and Beijing are at their worst in more than 40 years as China increases military flights within the island’s air defense zone. Taiwanese officials say nearly 150 aircraft belonging to China's air force have entered the zone in the last four days. The U.S. State Department called China‘s latest actions destabilizing and risky, while China has taken offense to the presence of U.S. ships in the Taiwan Strait. President Joe Biden says Chinese President Xi Jinping has agreed to abide by the "Taiwan agreement," which allows Washington to maintain a relationship with and sell arms to Taiwan.
TITLE=> Graham Pushes Bill in Response to Weekend's Mass Shootings.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden Picks Yellen for Treasury Secretary. ARTICLE=> On Monday, it was reported that projected 2020 election winner Joe Biden planned to nominate Janet Yellen for Treasury secretary. If confirmed, Yellen would become the first woman to fill the role once held by Alexander Hamilton. Yellen previously served as the first female Chair of the Federal Reserve under President Barack Obama. She also served on the Federal Reserve Board from 1994 to 1997 and again from 2010 to 2018. From 1997 to 1999, Yellen served as Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. Voices in center- and left-rated outlets were generally supportive of choosing Yellen for Treasury secretary. Voices in right-rated outlets were mixed, offering some criticism and some optimism.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Cheerleader in Student Free Speech Case. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 on Wednesday that a Pennsylvania school district violated the First Amendment by suspending a cheerleader, Brandi Levy, from the junior varsity team for a year over a profanity-laden Snapchat rant. Public schools can still regulate some off-campus speech, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, adding, “Circumstances that may implicate a school’s regulatory interests include serious or severe bullying or harassment targeting particular individuals; threats aimed at teachers or other students; the failure to follow rules concerning lessons, the writing of papers, the use of computers, or participation in other online school activities; and breaches of school security devices.” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the court's decision ignored precedent and that Levy's rant could have harmed the school's athletic program.  Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Some coverage pointed to different arguments from Justice Thomas' dissent. Some right-rated outlets like Washington Examiner instead featured Wednesday's other Supreme Court rulings, including limiting police ability to conduct warrantless searches and striking down a California rule allowing labor organizers to visit farm laborers in fields. 
TITLE=> Facebook Under Fire for Data Harvesting. ARTICLE=> Facebook is currently under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission after it was revealed that President Trump's campaign used a political analysis company to harvest personal information from millions of users without their permission. While the move has been condemned by many across the aisle, some on the Right argue that Obama engaged in the same practice during his 2012 campaign, although it is acknowledged that he did so with user consent.
TITLE=> Congress, Trump Administration Searching for Middle Ground on New Stimulus. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Tuesday and are scheduled to speak again Wednesday regarding a new coronavirus stimulus package. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he'd support holding a vote on the measure, but did not say when a vote might be held or how he'd vote on it. The bill Pelosi and Mnuchin are discussing will reportedly cost between $1.8 trillion and $2.2 trillion. Coverage from some left- and center-rated outlets focused more on anonymously sourced reports of McConnell's purported reluctance to finish a deal prior to the presidential election on November 3. Conversely, reports from right-rated sources concentrated more on McConnell's Tuesday comments saying he'd support holding a vote on the measure at some point. Outlets on all sides reported on apparent tension among Senate Republicans over the new bill's cost; CNBC also released poll data suggesting a majority of voters would rather see the Senate work out a stimulus package than nominate a new Supreme Court justice before the election.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Should Gen. Milley Be Fired Over Calls With Top Chinese General?. ARTICLE=> Gen. Mark Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, is facing criticism over phone calls he had with China's top general last year. According to a forthcoming book, Milley acted to limit former President Donald Trump's powers and told the Chinese general that he'd warn him of any forthcoming U.S. attack. After the book's contents became public, Trump accused Milley of treason. President Joe Biden said he has "great confidence" in Milley Wednesday. A spokesperson for Milley tweeted Thursday defended the calls, saying they were done to "maintain strategic stability." Contrary to initial reports, sources across the spectrum say the calls were not secret and that 13 other people were present, including a State Department official. Voices on the right have been highly critical of Milley. Many argue that if the book is accurate, Milley stepped outside the chain of command and unjustly undermined the president. Some called for him to resign or be fired, including several Republican lawmakers and retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified against Trump in his first impeachment trial. An analysis from CNN (Left bias) suggested the book's claims raised more concerns about Trump's mental fitness. A report from Politico (Lean Left bias) suggested the authors exaggerated the calls and that Trump Defense Sec. Chris Miller approved them. Miller denied that narrative in a recent Fox News (Right bias) interview.
TITLE=> House Passes Resolution Formalizing Impeachment Probe. ARTICLE=> The House, in a 232 to 196 vote Thursday morning, approved a resolution formalizing an impeachment probe.

TITLE=> Biden Defends Afghanistan Withdrawal, Says Mission Will End August 31. ARTICLE=> Speaking from the East Room of the White House on Thursday, President Joe Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, saying that the withdrawal was on track to end by August 31. “The United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan,” Biden said, adding, “we did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build.” The remarks come amid renewed scrutiny of the withdrawal and just a week after U.S. forces reportedly left Bagram Airfield, a key military base, “in the dead of night” without informing Afghan allies. Prior to Biden's remarks, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the U.S. would not have a celebratory “mission accomplished moment” over the end of the war.  Coverage was prominently featured across the spectrum. Coverage in some right-rated outlets tended to frame the U.S. exit from Afghanistan less favorably, calling Psaki’s “no mission accomplished” remarks “grim.”
TITLE=> Nationwide Protests Against Immigrant Family Separation. ARTICLE=> Thousands of protesters marched in cities across the United States on Saturday calling for an end to the separation of immigrant families at the border.

ARTICLE=> Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council staff member who was called as a witness by Democrats in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, was 'escorted' from the White House today, according to a statement from his lawyer. He testified during November's House impeachment inquiry, saying the president's conduct in dealing with Ukraine was "improper." As of early Friday evening, left- and center-rated outlets reported more broadly on the news than right-rated sources. Some right-leaning coverage framed the apparent firing as justified; some left-leaning voices focused more on the statement from Vindman's lawyer, who said Trump had enacted "revenge."
TITLE=> Added Scrutiny on Coronavirus Testing as Schools Reopen. ARTICLE=> The state of COVID-19 coronavirus testing in the U.S. has drawn additional attention and scrutiny as schools move to reopen safely. Some public health officials are calling for widespread testing before schools resume in-person classes; some federal officials are more in favor of less frequent testing more focused on people with symptoms or relationships with affected individuals. Some coverage from left-rated outlets concentrated on the purported need of having testing widely available as a prerequisite for reopening schools. Some reports from right-rated sources focused on examples of areas where positive test rates are decreasing, in turn suggesting that less rigid testing procedures may suffice.
TITLE=> Supreme Court to Hear Landmark Cases on LGBTQ+ Rights. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court of the United States is hearing arguments in a series of landmark cases relating to LGBTQ+ rights and whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act applies to sexual orientation. Appeals courts have been split, with one case ruled in favor of the petitioner and one against. Both men claimed to be fired for being gay.

TITLE=> Trump Administration Releases ‘1776 Commission’ Report. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Trump administration released “The 1776 Report,” a document that calls for “patriotic education that teaches the truth of America,” says founding fathers’ slave ownership was an unfortunate product of its time, and describes progressivism and identity politics as “challenges to America’s principles.” The White House says the commission features "some of America’s most distinguished scholars and historians"; the commission is largely made up of conservative thinkers and activists, and has been criticized, especially by academics, for lacking qualified professional historians. The report is a response to The New York Times Magazine’s “1619 Project,” an initiative to place “the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.”  Coverage in left-rated outlets was highly critical of the report, with some coverage focusing on criticisms by professional American historians and other coverage outright labeling it as “racist.” Coverage in center- and right-rated outlets was less common and tended to describe the report’s claims with less commentary and context, with some coverage from the right taking a more positive angle.

It also comes at the end of Biden’s first international trip, in which he will visit the U.K. and Belgium for the G-7 and NATO summits. Tensions are high between the U.S. and Russia, due to Russia’s military buildup on the Ukrainian border; the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny; the Colonial Pipeline hack, allegedly carried out by a Russian-based cybercriminal group; Russia’s indifference towards Belarus’ recent and widely-criticized arrest of a journalist; U.S. sanctions on Russia over election interference and the SolarWinds hack; Russian nuclear deployments; and strong language used by the two leaders, including Biden calling Putin a "killer."

The 12-second clip, edited out of a 2019 C-SPAN interview with Trump, showed the president walking to a helicopter before stopping to point to a puddle on the ground outside of the White House. Some Twitter users tweeted the video along with comments that Trump looked "confused" and "disoriented." "Trump was simply walking back to wait for FLOTUS here," ABC reporter Will Steakin pointed out in a tweet. "This false tweet has over 23K retweets and the deceptively edited video has over 2 million views." On Monday, Twitter added a "manipulated media" tag to the video, and it was apparently taken down shortly after. Voices from all sides of the political spectrum condemned the tweet as misinformation, calling it a "disservice to voters" when either side spreads false claims or misleading information.
TITLE=> Trump Avoids Praising John Lewis in Interview. ARTICLE=> In an interview with “Axios on HBO” released Monday, President Donald Trump was asked for his thoughts on the late Rep. John Lewis, a noted civil rights figure who garnered praise from all sides after his passing on July 17. Trump avoided directly praising Lewis, noting that the late congressman had not attended his inauguration or State of the Union addresses. The interview was originally recorded on Tuesday, July 28th. Many outlets focused specifically on this part of the interview. As of Tuesday, relatively few right-rated sources had covered the interview, with most reporting coming from center- and left-rated sources. While right-rated sources that reported generally covered the interview neutrally, coverage from some left-rated outlets framed Trump’s comments as shocking, selfish or antagonistic. Coverage from both sides of the spectrum mentioned Lewis’ civil rights history and praise from other political figures.
TITLE=> U.S. Charges Chinese Citizens with Hacking More Than 100 U.S. Companies. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the Justice Department charged five Chinese citizens with allegedly hacking over 100 United States companies and institutions, including social media and video game apps, and universities and communications providers.

It was Wray's first Congressional testimony since the breach; the Justice Department has since charged more than 300 people with crimes including obstructing Congress, conspiracy and assaulting police. Wray's testimony was covered more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets. Some reports from left-rated sources focused on how Wray cast doubt on the notion that Antifa was involved with the breach. Coverage was less prominent from right-rated sources; some highlighted Republican senators who expressed concern during the hearing about the FBI using GPS to track suspects.

On Dec. 23, Trump requested Congress raise the amount to $2,000; some Democrat lawmakers supported the raise, while Republicans resisted, causing another impasse. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame Trump in a negative light, criticizing him for delaying the signature while playing golf at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

Perspectives emerged across the spectrum regarding the alleged anarchy from protesters and purported promotion of a police state by the Trump administration. Coverage from some left-rated outlets focused on criticizing purported exaggerations of the violence from right-leaning media. Some right-rated voices concentrated on alleged failures by Democrat leaders accused of being too soft on violent protesters and damage to public property. A story about a Navy veteran allegedly beaten by officers with batons was the focus of media coverage on all sides of the spectrum.

Some voices across the spectrum framed this as a power grab; others focused on the possible splitting of GOP resources.

TITLE=> Intelligence Community Divided and Uncertain on COVID-19 Origins in New Report. ARTICLE=> US intelligence agencies reached varied and relatively uncertain conclusions on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an unclassified two-page report released Friday. Four unnamed intelligence agencies and the National Intelligence Council assessed with low confidence that the virus most likely originated naturally, one agency assessed with moderate confidence that the virus most likely came from a “laboratory-associated incident,” and three agencies said they were unable to come to a conclusion without additional information. All agencies agreed that both origin theories were “plausible,” that the virus was not a biological weapon, and that Chinese officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the first outbreak. Both the report and a statement from President Joe Biden criticized China for withholding information and called on China to cooperate with investigators. Biden had requested the intelligence community’s investigation in May.  While many outlets covered leaks of the report’s conclusions as early as Aug. 24, outlets across the spectrum covered the report’s release on Friday. Some coverage in left-rated outlets highlighted China’s lack of foreknowledge of the virus. Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on the lab leak theory.
TITLE=> Amid Massive Flight Disruptions, Southwest Airlines Disputes Connection To Vaccine Mandate Protests. ARTICLE=> Amid a series of massive flight disruptions, Southwest Airlines denounced “unfounded rumor and speculation” that the company’s recent decision to mandate vaccinations spurred cancellations and delays. The airline attributed the "high volume of cancellations" and delays to “weather challenges” in Florida and “unexpected air traffic control issues in the same region.” Southwest canceled a total of 1,826 flights and delayed 1,784 flights on Saturday and Sunday, according to data from FlightAware. The disruptions continued into Monday with over 360 cancellations and 1,300 delays. Other airlines were not as severely impacted by these issues; airlines such as American and Spirit canceled 2% of flights over the holiday weekend. The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) on Friday filed a motion to temporarily block the airline's COVID-19 vaccine mandate until an ongoing lawsuit over alleged U.S. labor law violations is resolved; the airline emphasized that the matter won't "require negotiation" moving forward. SWAPA released a statement that claimed pilots and airline staff were not planning a sickout over the company's vaccination requirements, saying that "management's poor planning" and "external operational challenges" were more probable causes of the cancellations. Coverage was prominent across the spectrum, with many outlets citing conflicting tallies for the total number of flights canceled. Right-rated voices were more likely to link the cancellations to vaccine mandates protests, a narrative advanced by Texas Republicans Ted Cruz and Chip Roy on Twitter. Some left-rated voices criticized those outlets for making such a connection "even though they offered no evidence of it."
TITLE=> Klobuchar Suspends Presidential Campaign, Endorses Biden. ARTICLE=> Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) suspended her 2020 presidential campaign Monday morning and announced her support for former Vice President Joe Biden. Klobuchar mustered seven delegates in South Carolina's primary Saturday, coming in fifth place overall.

TITLE=> How States are Working with Federal Government on Coronavirus. ARTICLE=> Interactions between President Donald Trump and state governors, especially Democrats, have been a focus during the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, as the federal government decides how much help to provide to governors based on the extent of the pandemic's toll in their state. Three governors of three historically blue states — Gavin Newsom (CA), J.B. Pritzker (IL), and Andrew Cuomo (NY) — have traded jabs with the President, with some media outlets accusing Trump of intentionally withholding help from blue states until they stop criticizing him. Pritzker and Trump are the two richest elected officials in the United States, respectively.
TITLE=> ACLU, Planned Parenthood Amongst Plaintiffs in Lawsuit Against Alabama's New Abortion Law. ARTICLE=> The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood were large names amongst a group of plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit against Alabama, Friday morning. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood sued the Attorney General of Alabama and a list of District Attorneys for the state, attempting to stall the most restrictive abortion law in the country from going into effect in November. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed lawsuits against other states and their abortion bans; recently, a federal judge accepted an injunction against the State of Kentucky, striking down an abortion law which banned second trimester abortions, just weeks ago. The speculated goal, of both the states and the plaintiffs, seems to be to set up a duel in the ideologically conservative Supreme Court, in an attempt to overturn parts of Roe v. Wade.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rules Against Immigrants With Temporary Protected Status Seeking Green Cards. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that unauthorized immigrants who entered the country and were temporarily allowed to remain are not eligible to become permanent residents. Justice Elena Kagan said on behalf the court that the ruling was a "a straightforward application” of the law, which requires lawful admission into the U.S. in order to be eligible for a green card. The court also said that even if a person is later granted temporary protected status for humanitarian crises in their home country, the lawful admission requirement remains. Currently, more than 400,000 people currently live in the U.S. under temporary protected status. Kagan also wrote that Congress is considering the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021, which would recognize temporary protected status recipients as lawfully admitted. The bill passed the Democratic-controlled House in March, but will likely face more challenges in the Senate. The case arose after two unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador attempted to use the temporary protected status to gain lawful admission after entering the country illegally in the 1990s following a 2001 earthquake in their home country.  The story received consistent coverage across the political spectrum.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Release of Mueller Documents. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court denied a motion Wednesday to release grand jury materials collected as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation to the House Judiciary Committee. House Democrats have until June 1st to brief the high court on why the full case should be heard, arguing that there is an "ongoing presidential impeachment investigation." The Department of Justice has argued that releasing the documents will breach grand jury secrecy. Left-rated and right-rated outlets had few divergences in reporting, with many focusing on the fact that the blockage is temporary. Some left-rated voices suggested that DOJ efforts to keep the documents secret implies some form of guilt on the part of the Trump administration. Some right-rated voices suggested that House Democrats were fishing for a crime after failing in their attempt to impeach and remove President Donald Trump.
TITLE=> CNN Hosts Final Town Hall Before New Hampshire Primary. ARTICLE=> CNN will host the final set of nationally televised town halls before the start of the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 11.

TITLE=> Retired St. Louis Police Captain Killed Amid Protests, Violence. ARTICLE=> Retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn was shot and killed early Tuesday morning amid protests and violence in the wake of George Floyd's death last week.

Right-rated outlets covered the story prominently, with many framing the killing in the context of the riots following Floyd's death. Left-rated outlets covered the story less closely, with most differentiating between protesters and looters as two distinct groups. Many right-rated outlets also focused on President Trump's condemnation of Dorn's killing via Twitter.
TITLE=> Sanders Releases Doctors' Letters Saying He's "In Good Health".

TITLE=> Biden Apologizes for Response to CNN Reporter After Putin Meeting. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden apologized after a curt encounter with a CNN reporter at a solo news conference Wednesday following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins asked Biden why he felt so "confident" Putin would change his behavior. Biden replied, ""I'm not confident he'll change his behavior. What in the hell, what do you do all the time?...I said what will change their behavior is if the rest of the world reacts to them and diminishes their standing in the world." After Collins pressed Biden for an answer on why he said he considered the meeting "constructive," he replied, "If you don't understand that, you're in the wrong business," before finally walking away. Biden's response garnered wide backlash from reporters on social media. Later, Biden addressed reporters before boarding a plane and apologized for his exchange with Collins. “I apologise for having been short,” Biden said, adding, “You never ask positive questions...Look, to be a good reporter, you’ve gotta be negative. You’ve gotta have a negative view of life, it seems to me, the way you all ... you never ask a positive question.” Some criticized Biden for "demeaning" behavior toward a female reporter. Some on the right used the incident to draw parallels between Biden's relationship with the media and Trump's relationship with the media; some right voices also highlighted the fact that Biden sometimes pre-selects journalists during press conferences and "flips out" when pressed by reporters. Others on the left said Biden shouldn't have lost his temper, but criticized Collins for allegedly putting words in Biden's mouth. 
TITLE=> US Releases Report on Jamal Khashoggi Killing. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration released a declassified intelligence report Friday concluding that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the 2018 operation to capture or kill Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. President Joe Biden told reporters on Wednesday that he had read the report. Biden called Saudi Arabia’s King Salman prior to the release in their first conversation since Biden took office. Additionally, CNN reported Thursday that the private jets used by Khashoggi’s killers were owned by a company previously seized by the crown prince. Coverage and original reporting were more common in left- and center-rated outlets than in right-rated outlets. Outlets on all sides tended to cover at least one aspect of the story, with some center-rated outlets publishing separate articles on each development.
TITLE=> Nancy Pelosi Elected Speaker of the House. ARTICLE=> As Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi won the speakership, vowing to focus on climate change, health care, and LGBTQ equality. Some criticized Pelosi and the Democrats for their agenda, characterizing it as fiscally irresponsible, weak on border security, and obstructionist in their plans to investigate President Trump. Others hailed the new Speaker as a political powerhouse capable of outsmarting Trump and savvily executing the party's legislative goals over the next two years.
TITLE=> Thousands Walk Off GM Jobs as UAW Strike Starts. ARTICLE=> After negotiations for a new contract fell through on Sunday night, the United Auto Workers called for a strike against General Motors. At least 45,000 auto workers walked off the job at midnight; the last strike of this magnitude was in 2007, and cost GM about $600 million. UAW was scheduled to re-negotiate contracts with three major automobile makers, opting to mediate with GM first. Both sides met again Monday to continue negotiations. The strike drew comment from President Trump, who urged both sides to make a deal. President Trump first tweeted about the negotiations in March, encouraging both sides to get the contract done early to avoid strikes.
TITLE=> US Economy Adds 128,000 Jobs In October, Unemployment Rises.

ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing a list of dozens of pardons and commutations for release within the next two days— a list that currently does not include himself, family members or close aides. Fox News reported that rapper Lil Wayne is expected to be in Trump's pardon list, while former Trump associate Steve Bannon's place on the list has yet to be determined. The president has made a number of high-profile pardons throughout his term; these include recent pardons for 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort, former adviser Roger Stone, and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, all of whom were charged with crimes relating to the Mueller investigation. Some speculated the president may attempt to pardon himself after he was impeached earlier this month by the Democratic-led House on charges of inciting the Capitol breach on Jan. 6. The story was covered by media outlets across the political spectrum. Right-rated outlets tended to focus on potential pardons and Trump's pardoning history; left-rated outlets tended to highlight Trump's decision not to pardon himself or his close aides and family members, and debated whether Trump pardoning himself would be considered constitutional.
TITLE=> Whistleblower Says Trump Admin Overturned 25 Security Clearance Denials. ARTICLE=> An 18-year career White House staffer told congressional investigators that the Trump administration granted 25 security clearances to individuals whose applications were initially denied over "disqualifying issues."

The government is all-male and includes several veteran Taliban leaders from the 1990’s government. Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund, who served as deputy prime minister in the previous government, was named acting prime minister. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban co-founder who led negotiations with the U.S. and other countries, was named acting deputy prime minister. The announcement came as hundreds in Kabul protested to resist the Taliban and maintain the gains made in women’s rights under the previous government.  Coverage was more prominent in left- and center-rated outlets on Tuesday evening. Some center- and left-rated outlets highlighted that the Taliban government was all-male. Some coverage in right-rated outlets called several Taliban government appointees “terrorists.”
TITLE=> Trump Retweets #FireFauci Tweet. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump sparked speculation about his relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci after he retweeted a post from former Republican congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine that called for Dr. Fauci to be fired.

TITLE=> Michigan House Repeals Emergency Powers Law Used By Gov. Whitmer To Fight COVID-19. ARTICLE=> Michigan legislators have repealed the Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945, which allowed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to quickly enforce health and safety restrictions early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. Four Democrats joined the Republican-led state House in a 60-48 vote on Wednesday, declaring the law unconstitutional. The broad powers allowed governors to declare an emergency to “protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation within the affected area under control.” The state Senate approved the Unlock Michigan initiative on July 15. The 76-year-old law's expulsion was prominently featured in right-rated and local Michigan outlets; many left-rated and center-rated outlets did not cover the news. Right-rated headlines emphasized how Whitmer was "stripped of emergency powers." Some left-rated outlets highlighted how Whitmer "championed" the need for citizens to get vaccinated after Michigan became a COVID-19 hotspot.
TITLE=> CFO of Trump Organization Surrenders Ahead of Facing Charges. ARTICLE=> Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, surrendered to federal prosecutors on Thursday ahead of expected criminal tax charges.  The exact charges were not immediately known, but they may focus on whether Trump Organization officials received benefits and perks, such as leased cars and rent-free apartments, without reporting them correctly on their tax returns. The Trump Organization says that Weisselberg is being used as a pawn to harm former President Donald Trump, though Trump himself is not expected to face any charges. An indictment of Weisselberg could undermine the Trump Organization's relationship with business partners and banks, and lead to fines and other penalties.
TITLE=> Sports Leagues Boycott Games In Response to Jacob Blake Shooting. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) refused to take the floor for their game against the Orlando Magic in response to police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The Bucks' boycott prompted WNBA, MLS, the rest of the NBA and some MLB teams to cancel their Wednesday games. In a statement from the Bucks, the team said that after seeing the video of Blake's shooting several times in their home state, "our focus today cannot be on basketball." The players said the purpose of their boycott was to push for the "Wisconsin State Legislature to reconvene after months of inaction to take up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform." The NBA held a meeting Wednesday night to discuss next steps; teams voted to continue the playoff season, though Thursday's games will be postponed. As of Wednesday evening, coverage was consistent across all sides of the political spectrum; some coverage from left-and center-rated outlets frame the players' boycott as a "significant step" toward racial justice.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Facebook Board Upholds Trump Ban. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump's ban from Facebook has sparked debates about free speech, speech that encourages violence, and online censorship. It's also elicited vastly different reactions from media voices and pundits across the spectrum. Facebook's Oversight Board announced Wednesday it supported upholding the company's ban of Trump, but criticized the company for apparently breaking its own rules by "imposing a suspension that was indefinite." The board ordered Facebook to review the ban within the next six months. Many voices published in prominent left-rated media outlets called for the ban to be permanent, with one columnist saying Trump is "unhinged and manipulative enough to use platforms such as Facebook to do serious harm." Many voices from right-rated outlets were critical of Facebook and the ban, framing it as politically-motivated censorship; one warned that "if Big Tech continues to feel emboldened to silence a sitting president, they can and will silence the rest of us." Some on the right also praised the board for questioning the ban's permanence. Others focused on public opinion around the ban; data from Pew Research Center says 50% of Americans oppose a permanent social media ban on Trump, and 49% support it.
TITLE=> Trump Addresses Congress. ARTICLE=> In his first Presidential Address to a joint session of Congress, Donald Trump took a consolatory tone and laid out his vision for America.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The 13 US Service Members Killed in Kabul. ARTICLE=> Thirteen U.S. service members were among more than 170 people killed in last Thursday's suicide bombing at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan amid the nationwide evacuation effort.

Nikoui, 20. Navy Corpsman Maxton W. Soviak, 22, and Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss, 23 were also killed. 	Many voices across the spectrum, especially on the right, highlighted the fallen service members, their backgrounds, what they left behind, how their death impacted their communities back home, and how Americans were moving to honor them. Most highlighted how young most of the fallen were, and often contrasted that with the 20 years of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan. Some on the left focused more on the two female Marine sergeants; some on the right profiled the service members while also blaming President Joe Biden for their deaths.
TITLE=> May Jobs Report Sparks Debate on Who Deserves Credit for Strong Economy. ARTICLE=> With the recent release of the May jobs report which showed further economic expansion, perspectives vary on who deserves the credit.

TITLE=> Bipartisan Outcry as National Guardsmen Told to Sleep in Parking Garage. ARTICLE=> After reportedly being told to take their breaks in a parking garage Thursday, thousands of National Guardsmen in Washington D.C. have been allowed back inside the Capitol Complex to take their rest time. Photos showing troops sleeping on the floor of the parking garage quickly went viral on social media, prompting lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to condemn the move as disrespectful. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), who are typically polar opposites on matters of policy, each took to Twitter to express support for the troops and offer their government office spaces as places to rest. Many others in both major parties did the same. Reports on both sides of the media spectrum were often similar, and focused on the bipartisan nature of the outcry. Some right-rated outlets focused more on responses from Republican lawmakers; some left-rated sources concentrated more on how Democrat lawmakers responded.
TITLE=> Conflicting Narratives on Whether Trump Has Condemned White Supremacy. ARTICLE=> Differing narratives have emerged on the president's attitudes toward white supremacy following his controversial response to a question about white supremacy at the presidential debate earlier this week. Some politicians and others on both the left and right say Trump's response to the question was a disturbing refusal to denounce right-wing extremism. Others say it's not as simple, and reference the president's past comments on the subject; following mass shootings in Ohio and Texas last year, Trump said "our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy." Thursday evening, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity, "I condemn the KKK, I condemn all White supremacists, I condemn the Proud Boys. I don't know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing, but I condemn that." News coverage from many left- and some center-rated sources is more focused on Trump's debate answer, and the idea that it was dangerous and a concerning failure to denounce violent hate groups. Coverage from right-rated sources is focused on both the recent comment and Trump's past denouncements of white supremacy, and also on purported falsities being disseminated by sources who report on the president's alleged refusal to condemn white supremacy. Editor's Note: Updated 10/2/20 at 8:20 a.m. ET to include the president's comments from Thursday.
TITLE=> Mueller Says Trump is Currently Not Criminal Target in Russia Probe. ARTICLE=> Robert Mueller reportedly told President Trump's legal team that he is investigating the president but "does not consider him a criminal target at this point."

ARTICLE=> A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the dismissal of the criminal case again President Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI.

TITLE=> Coronavirus Commands News Cycle. ARTICLE=> The Covid-19 coronavirus and its spread have garnered media coverage from all sides of the spectrum, with focus on its connections to many aspects of everyday life; religion, the stock market, Capitol Hill politics and healthcare, to name a few. President Donald Trump's request for $2.5 billion to combat the disease's spread was deemed too low by Congress, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) instead asking for $8.5 billion. The Center for Disease Control recently warned that North America could soon see a more extreme outbreak of the virus.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Denies Remington's Sandy Hook Appeal. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court denied case review to Remington Arms Co., a gun manufacturer being sued by the families of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting victims for "knowingly" advertising the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle for "military style" civilian use, in a decision Tuesday morning. A 2005 federal law prevents gun makers from being legally culpable for the illegal use of their products, but plaintiffs are reportedly suing for wrongful death under Connecticut advertising laws. While the decision does not place Remington at immediate liability, discovery in the lower court case will proceed.

ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives voted 228-164 Friday to federally decriminalize marijuana, the first time Congress has acted on the matter. Legislators voted mostly along party lines; five Republicans and the House's one independent member voted yes, and six Democrats voted no. The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to reject the bill. Following the November elections, 15 states have now legalized marijuana, and 38 states allow medical marijuana. Data from Gallup released in early November suggests more than two-thirds of Americans support legalizing the drug. The news was covered widely throughout the spectrum. Some reports from right-rated outlets concentrated on GOP criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for purportedly prioritizing this bill instead of COVID-19 coronavirus relief.
TITLE=> Trump Travels to Puerto Rico. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump will travel to Puerto Rico today to meet with FEMA and military officials, first responders, and the people of Puerto Rico.

TITLE=> White House Ceremony Remembers 500,000 Lives Lost to COVID-19 In US. ARTICLE=> On Monday, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a moment of silence for Americans who have died from COVID-19 after the United States reached 500,000 deaths from the virus this week. Biden and Harris, along with First Lady Jill Biden and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, looked over 500 candles lit on the South Lawn of the White House as a Marine Corps band played "Amazing Grace." In a brief address to the nation, Biden acknowledged that the number of "Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic is more than in World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined," and more lives lost to the virus than any other country. “[As] we acknowledge the scale of this mass death in America, we remember each person and the life they lived,” Biden said, sharing his personal experiences with grief. "It's also important to do that as a nation. Those who have lost loved ones, here's what I know: They're never truly gone. They'll always be part of your heart." The number comes more than a year after the first case of COVID-19 was announced stateside on Jan. 21; John Hopkins estimates there have been more than 28 million infections in the nation. The ceremony received coverage across the political spectrum. Some outlets from the left and center compared Biden's response to former President Donald Trump's attempts to "downplay" the scale of the pandemic.
TITLE=> Stock Market in Historic Slide as Coronavirus Fears Escalate. ARTICLE=> All three major U.S. stock indexes — the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — suffered their largest one-day losses in history Thursday, as the global economy continued to slide over coronavirus fears.

TITLE=> Thunberg Speaks to United Nations. ARTICLE=> 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg spoke at the United Nations on Monday, capturing international attention with an emotional plea advocating for climate awareness. Many on the right, including President Donald Trump, framed Thunberg as a child being exploited by the left for political gain. Right-leaning commentator Michael Knowles called Thunberg "mentally ill" on Fox News; as a result, the network apologized and banned him from coming on again. Media voices from all sides have rebuked Knowles. Many on the right have criticized Thunberg, while many on the left have been critical of President Trump's reaction.
TITLE=> Dems Push Forward on $1.9T Pandemic Aid; GOP Concerned with Cost. ARTICLE=> Congressional Democrats plan to move ahead on President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package next week, as Republican lawmakers criticize the cost and Democrats' purported inflexibility on the details. Instead of getting the 60 Senate votes usually needed to pass legislation, Democrats could use something called budget reconciliation to advance the proposal with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. Budget reconciliation can be used once per fiscal year in the Senate to resolve budget-related issues; Republicans tried to use it twice during Trump's administration. Stimulus checks details remain a particular point of division. Some progressive Democrats have asked Biden to consider recurring stimulus payments; others are asking Biden to cut off payments for families earning over $75,000. Coverage on all sides of the spectrum explained the Senate rules that would allow Democrats to advance the legislation without any Republican support. Many left- and center-rated outlets highlight Democrat lawmakers' remarks about pushing ahead and the need for more relief. Many reports from right-rated outlets highlighted GOP concerns that the package is unnecessarily expensive, and that a forced effort from Democrats would damage efforts at congressional bipartisanship.
TITLE=> Global Climate Strike. ARTICLE=> Across the world people have taken to protesting leaders for inaction on climate change. From college campuses at universities to major cities around the globe—people young and old are marching to catch the attention of world leaders. This as the United Nations holds its Climate Action Summit in New York City, on Monday the 23rd. Notable teenage activists including Greta Thunberg showed up demanding actions similar to that outlined in the Green New Deal. Left-leaning sources have praised the strike as a democratic way to get leaders to wake up to causes. Few right-leaning sources have dissented, but those that have, rebuked violent protest signs and what they deemed 'unfounded' criticisms of capitalism.
TITLE=> Were This Year's Presidential Election Polls Right or Wrong?. ARTICLE=> After national opinion polls seemed to underestimate President Donald Trump's popularity ahead of the 2016 presidential election, some are wondering whether this may be the case again in 2020. Democratic nominee Joe Biden led Trump in many national polls going into Tuesday, and some forecasted his lead as being stronger than Hillary Clinton's was four years ago. Some voices throughout the spectrum, especially on the left, focused on purported differences in polling methods for this year's election compared to the one in 2016, and also on Biden ostensibly holding a stronger lead than Clinton did. Some right-rated voices voiced an expectation that polls again underestimated Trump's popularity and didn't do enough to fully represent the national voting body, including young people and those in rural areas.
TITLE=> Are Building Standards Too Restrictive?. ARTICLE=> President Trump is rolling back Obama's flood standards for infrastructure. Some have criticized the current standards as too costly and burdensome. Others argue that the rule has protected critical infrastructure and taxpayer dollars.
TITLE=> Obama Reduces Sentence for Manning. ARTICLE=> US President Barack Obama has commuted Chelsea Manning's sentence for leaking documents to Wikileaks in 2010. The 29-year-old transgender US Army private, born Bradley Manning, will be freed on 17 May instead of her scheduled 2045 release.
TITLE=> No Change to Transgender Policy. ARTICLE=> The top military official in the United States, Joseph Dunford, has announced he will not carry out Trump's ban on transgender troops as directed on the president's Twitter.

TITLE=> 1.3 Million New Jobless Claims Last Week; Media Frames Number Differently. ARTICLE=> According to the most recent statistics from the Department of Labor, roughly 1.3 million new unemployment claims were filed last week. Coverage from right-rated outlets mostly framed the report as signs of the economy getting better, with less new Americans filing for unemployment and claims falling below the 1.4 million that were reportedly expected. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources concentrated more on persistent layoffs and the overall severity of the COVID-19 coronavirus' impact on the economy and jobs. Some left-rated voices focused specifically on the now 16-week streak of jobless filings surpassing 1 million, and the roughly 50 million unemployment claims filed since the pandemic's outset.
TITLE=> Reports Say DACA Is Over. ARTICLE=> President Trump will announce on Tuesday that he is ending a controversial program that protects nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, media reports indicated late Sunday.
TITLE=> Duckworth and Carlson Feud Over Patriotism. ARTICLE=> Fox News Host and Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson came under fire this week for allegedly questioning the patriotism of Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). Duckworth, a U.S. army veteran who lost both legs while co-piloting a helicopter in Iraq, responded to Carlson's criticism with quips including "walk a day in my legs" and "these titanium legs don't buckle." Duckworth, also a woman of color, is reportedly in the conversation to be Joe Biden's running mate. Right-rated outlets have largely backed off supporting Carlson due to his 'critiques' being perceived as 'nativist attacks.' It should be noted that a pair of Duckworth's ancestors did fight for the colonies in the American Revolution. Left-rated outlets have attacked Carlson for promoting the idea that anyone affiliated with the Democratic Party is not a patriot.
TITLE=> Tulsi Gabbard Drops Presidential Campaign. ARTICLE=> Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) suspended her 2020 bid for the White House Thursday. Gabbard's campaign leaned on anti-establishment and anti-war views; she was the last woman and last war veteran running in the 2020 race, and the last person of color running for the Democratic nomination. Rep. Gabbard, who is not seeking re-election for her seat in Congress this cycle, is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden. Some right-rated voices framed her absence from Democratic debates as evidence of the party's effort to suppress her campaign. Some left-rated voices criticized Gabbard for staying in the race and continuing to take donations from supporters, despite purportedly knowing she had little chance of winning the nomination.
TITLE=> Many Invoke Frederick Douglass' Words Amid Racial Tensions this Fourth of July. ARTICLE=> Amid racial tensions and disputes over historical monuments this Fourth of July, many invoke the words of abolitionist, writer and former slave Frederick Douglass. Some of Douglass' works include a letter about a monument he dedicated in Washington, D.C. in 1876. The letter explored the ways monuments open up spaces for public dialogue, and the limits to which monuments convey historical truths. Douglass' 1852 Independence Day address "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" is both a criticism of racism and slavery and a praise of the American Revolution. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum highlighted Douglass' speech; NPR tweeted a video of Douglass' descendants reciting the address. Coverage from the left tended to focus on the parallels between Douglass' time and now, while right-rated outlets also emphasized Douglass' praise of the American Revolution. Some center-rated outlets also featured Douglass' nuanced perspective when it came to monuments.
TITLE=> FBI Contacts 2nd Kavanaugh Accuser. ARTICLE=> The FBI has contacted Deborah Ramirez, who has accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. The accusations were said to have occurred when Kavanaugh was a Yale student.

ARTICLE=> On Monday, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump has financial ties to a company that manufactures the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which the president has said could be a potential treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus. There is no known cure for COVID-19. Most outlets, regardless of rating, reported that the president's stake in Sanofi is relatively small, amounting to $3,000 or less. Some left-rated outlets framed the president's touting of hydroxychloroquine as an attempt to use his political platform to further his personal financial interests. Trump is the second wealthiest elected U.S. official, behind Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.
TITLE=> State Department Says Mike Pompeo Took Part In Ukraine Phone Call. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took part in President Trump's July 25th phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the State Department and media reports.

TITLE=> U.S. Troops Leaving Syria Met with Public Disdain. ARTICLE=> Monday, people in the Syrian city of Qamishli threw objects and yelled insults at U.S. military personnel as they began their relocation to Iraq. President Donald Trump withdrew troops from northern Syria two weeks ago, which Turkey followed with an invasion and attack on formerly-U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. Many reporting outlets are connecting the troop withdrawal to a possible re-emergence of ISIS activity in the region.
TITLE=> Trump and Kim Exchange Insults. ARTICLE=> In response to a message from North Korea's foreign ministry that referred to President Trump as an "old lunatic," Trump responded by tweeting that he would never call Kim "short and fat" and that he tries to be Kim's friend. This exchange comes amid Trump's 12-day tour of Asia in which he has met with other world leaders about North Korea.
TITLE=> Trump Says He Declassifed Russia, Clinton Email Probe Documents. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said in a tweet Tuesday evening that he has declassified all documents relating to federal investigations into Russian election interference and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server for government emails with “no redactions.” This comes after Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe declassified information reporting that former President Barack Obama had been briefed on Hillary Clinton's alleged involvement with attempts to tie Trump to the Russian intelligence scandal during the 2016 presidential election. The story was covered by outlets from all sides of the political spectrum. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame Trump’s tweet, and other tweets by Trump Tuesday evening, as efforts to cast his political opponents in a bad light.
TITLE=> Moderna Says COVID-19 Vaccine 96% Effective in Teens. ARTICLE=> Moderna released results of its trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in teens age 12-17, saying it is 96% effective against the virus. The trial involved 3,235 participants; among those, 12 COVID-19 cases were recorded beginning 14 days after the first dose. The company said it has not identified any serious safety concerns to date. This comes after Pfizer and BioNTech last month found their COVID-19 vaccine to be 100% effective among ages 12-15. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to give emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine to be used among adolescents in the next week. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from left and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the trial; some right-rated outlets framed the news in the context of a return to in-person schooling in the fall.
TITLE=> First-of-its-kind California Program Offers Virus Aid to People in the Country Illegally. ARTICLE=> California has initiated a taxpayer-funded program to provide up to $500 in financial relief for individuals in the country illegally who are struggling amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The program, which is the first of its kind among the 50 states, is expected to support up to 150,000 people in California, and is reportedly valued at $75 million. As is typical with immigration-related issues, left-rated media describe people in the country illegally as 'undocumented", while right-rated media labels them as "illegal immigrants." Some center-rated outlets describe them as "unauthorized." Many reports, regardless of political leaning, explored potential flaws and technical issues with implementing the program.
TITLE=> Chief Justice Roberts Calls For Civility at Impeachment Trial. ARTICLE=> Chief Justice John Roberts, who is currently presiding over President Donald Trump's (R-FL) impeachment trial, took time out of Tuesday night's hearing to call for both sets of house managers to be more civil. Roberts took exception to name calling by both sides of the aisle (excluding senators who are required to be silent), specifically by White House counsel Pat Cippolone and House manager Jerry Nadler, urging the two sides to remember that they're "addressing the world's greatest deliberative body." Coverage of Roberts' statements from all sides of the political spectrum focused on the intensely partisan climate that has so far characterized the impeachment process.

This comes after former DNI Dan Coats resigned over the weekend. The position is designed to be non-partisan. Left-leaning media outlets have criticized the nomination as nepotism for Trump loyalists. Some right-leaning media report that Ratcliffe was not Trump's first choice, but a fitting choice nonetheless.

TITLE=> House Passes Bill to Remove Confederate Statues from Capitol. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House passed a bill Tuesday that would remove statues of figures from history associated with the Confederacy, slavery or racism. The legislation would remove several statues of Confederate leaders currently displayed in the U.S. Capitol under the National Statuary Hall Collection; it would also replace a bust of Roger B. Taney with Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice. The bill garnered a 285-120 bipartisan vote in favor, with 67 Republicans joining all Democrats present. Some GOP members said the removal process should the responsibility of individual states; each state is allowed to put two statues in the U.S. Capitol. The House voted to remove the statues last year, but the bill stalled in the then-Republican led Senate. House Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not yet said whether he will bring up the bill, though House Democrats say it is likely.  The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated sources framed the statues as more problematic than coverage from right-rated sources did.
TITLE=> Reports of Anti-Semitic Violence in US Amid Israel-Hamas Conflict. ARTICLE=> Several reports of American Jews being subjected to violence and harassment by pro-Palestinian groups arose this week amid the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas militants. In Los Angeles on Tuesday, a group of Jewish men was attacked while eating at a restaurant and suffered minor injuries. In New York City Thursday, Twitter video apparently showed pro-Palestinian people harassing diners at a restaurant. The Anti-Defamation League reported Thursday that "there have been numerous antisemitic incidents around the world related" to the Israel-Hamas violence. Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire Thursday after fighting that left at least 12 Israelis and 230 Palestinians dead. Reports of anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. were highlighted prominently by right-rated outlets, which often included video of altercations and focused on different incidents around the country, including in New York, California, Florida and Illinois. Left- and center-rated sources generally covered the news less frequently; left-rated outlets that did cover the news typically focused on the incident in Los Angeles and local leaders' response to it.
TITLE=> U.S. Jobless Claims Total 6.6 Million Last Week. ARTICLE=> Americans applied for unemployment benefits in massive numbers for the third straight week. According to the Labor Department, a total of 6.6 million people filed jobless claims during the week ending April 4th due to the coronavirus pandemic's economic shutdown.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Allows Pennsylvania Absentee Ballot Extension in 4-4 Tie. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court issued an order without explanation on Monday denying a request by Pennsylvania Republicans to block a lower-court ruling requiring Pennsylvania to count absentee ballots received up to three days after Election Day. The Court was split 4-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the three liberal justices, thus leaving the lower court’s decision intact. The decision could have a significant impact on the election; Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by less than one percentage point. Coverage in some center- and left-rated outlets framed the GOP’s request as an attempt to “limit mail-in voting," with other coverage on all sides framing the Court’s decision as “allowing an extension” of mail-in voting. Some coverage in left-rated outlets highlighted how Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation might affect future election disputes. Some coverage in right-rated outlets framed the decision as "favoring Democrats."
TITLE=> Second Migrant Child Dies At U.S. Border. ARTICLE=> A second child has died while in custody this month at the U.S. border, and CPB will be conducting health checks.
TITLE=> Suspect in Patriot Prayer Shooting Killed by Police, Media Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> On Thursday evening, a federal fugitive task force shot Michael Reinoehl when he allegedly tried to elude arrest. Reinoehl, a self-described anti-fascist, was charged with second-degree murder with a weapon and unlawful use of a weapon in the Aug. 29 shooting of Aaron “Jay” Danielson. Official accounts of Reinoehl's death from law enforcement differ slightly; the Thurston County Sheriff’s Department said in a press briefing that Reinoehl was running away when he was shot dead by officers with the Fugitive Task Force, while U.S. Marshals leading the task force said they attempted to "peacefully" arrest Reinoehl and shot him when he “produced a firearm, threatening the lives of law enforcement officers.”  According to a police affidavit unsealed Friday, Reinoehl appears to have targeted Danielson, who was wearing a cap bearing the symbol of right-wing group Patriot Prayers at the time of the shooting; Reinhoel purportedly waited in the alcove of a parking garage before emerging and firing two gunshots, one of which allegedly proved fatal. In an interview shortly before his death, Reinoehl told VICE he was acting in self-defense. Coverage from some left-rated outlets tended to highlight the discrepancies in official accounts of Reinoehl's death; coverage from some center- and right-rated outlets tended to frame Reinoehl as an antifa and Black Lives Matter supporter, also highlighting Reinoehl's potential targeting of Danielson. Some right-rated outlets also criticized some left-rated media outlets for purportedly downplaying Reinoehl's antifa ties.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The DOJ's Dismissal of Michael Flynn's Case. ARTICLE=> The media is starkly divided along partisan lines in reacting to the Justice Department's decision to dismiss charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the bureau as part of the Russia probe. Many left-rated voices decried perceived White House interference in getting the case dropped, with some accusing the Trump administration of fueling public animosity toward federal law enforcement. Many right-rated voices applauded the decision as the right move in correcting the FBI's supposedly politically-motivated investigation. Others took a less partisan stance, with some questioning why Flynn wouldn't tell the truth initially instead of pleading guilty.
TITLE=> Latest Mueller Hearings Highlight Different Party Priorities. ARTICLE=> Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's latest testimonies before Congress this week have prompted a wide variety of media opinions from throughout the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Texas Storm and Power Outages. ARTICLE=> A winter storm in Texas this week brought snow, ice, and power outages due to extra energy demand and frozen utility plants. Website poweroutage.us estimated 4.5 million customers went without electricity Tuesday, and 3.3 million on Wednesday. Ninety percent of the state's power is managed by The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The storm caused gas pipelines to seize up, wind turbines to freeze, oil wells to shut, and power plants to go offline. Representatives from ERCOT said there were 45,000 megawatts offline; 15,000 megawatts were sourced from wind, and 30,000 were gas and coal. In response, the Southwest Power Pool implemented rolling electricity outages lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to protect the grids from collapse. The U.S. Energy Department issued an emergency order allowing power plants to keep running despite possibly violating certain environmental limits, and President Joe Biden approved it. Some voices from the right, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, framed wind and solar energy as the culprit for the blackouts, casting doubt on climate change and the reliability of green energy, and criticizing the Green New Deal. Some voices from the left pointed to articles linking climate change to destabilization of the jet stream, which can lead to outbreaks of "Arctic air"; other voices from the left criticized the right for blaming Democrats and framed Texas officials' criticism of renewable energy as a ploy to boost Texas' fossil fuel industry.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Natural Immunity From COVID-19. ARTICLE=> The subject of natural immunity from COVID-19 is coming up more amid debates about the coronavirus vaccine, vaccine mandates and the spread of the Delta variant. According to multiple studies, people who survived COVID-19 are significantly less susceptible to reinfection; however, the length of immunity is unknown and likely differs from person to person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said recently that people who previously had COVID-19 but haven't been vaccinated are more than twice as likely to be reinfected than a fully vaccinated person.  There are conflicting expert opinions on natural immunity. Some health professionals cited natural immunity as a reason not to mandate vaccines, arguing that young people are highly unlikely to die from COVID-19; some also said focusing on mandates can damage trust in public health and the human body's ability to fight disease. Other experts said that because the timeline for immunity is unknown and because new and more dangerous COVID-19 variants could develop, natural immunity is less useful and herd immunity is unachievable.
TITLE=> Sweden Comment Raises Questions. ARTICLE=> When Donald Trump told supporters in Melbourne, Florida, Saturday evening that "we've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden," public attention turned to the Scandinavian country, expecting scenes of terror. Does Sweden have a refugee problem?
TITLE=> Pelosi Announces House Select Committee on January 6th. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she would establish a select committee to investigate the January 6th Capitol riot, four weeks after Senate Republicans blocked the creation of an independent bipartisan commission. “The select committee will investigate and report on the facts and the causes of the attack and it will report recommendations for the prevention of any future attack,” Pelosi said. Following reports that Pelosi was considering a select committee, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that he was sure the committee would be political “because that's the whole way that she's handled it.” Coverage on all sides varied on saying whether Pelosi herself, House Democrats or the House of Representatives would create the committee. Some coverage on all sides also compared this select committee to the committee created by Republicans in 2014 to investigate the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. 
TITLE=> Biden Meets With Leaders of Indo-Pacific Democracies in ‘Quad’ Summit. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden met virtually with leaders from Australia, India and Japan on Friday in the first meeting of heads of state from the “Quad,” an informal grouping of Indo-Pacific democracies. At the meeting, the four countries launched an effort to tackle Southeast Asia’s COVID-19 vaccine shortage, agreed to cooperate on technological development and discussed “aggression” from China. Biden and the other leaders—Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga—published an op-ed in the Washington Post on Saturday discussing the meeting and committing themselves to “an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure and prosperous.” Coverage followed similar narratives across bias ratings. Some coverage from across the spectrum focused specifically on the op-ed, the vaccine agreement, or the Quad's relationship to growing Chinese influence in the region.
TITLE=> New York City Terror Attack Leaves Four Wounded.

Many left-leaning media outlets focused on criticisms of the rule, with references to Trump's "pressuring" of the Guatemalan government. Some on the right framed the agreement as a win for Trump and a needed immigration policy move.

TITLE=> Southeast Hit by Gas Shortages After Colonial Pipeline Hack. ARTICLE=> Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina are implementing emergency measures to quell potential gasoline shortages after a cyberattack prompted a major pipeline to shutdown over the weekend. The Colonial Pipeline announced Saturday that operations would temporarily shut down following the ransomware attack. The pipeline delivers roughly 45% of all of fuel consumed along the east coast, and reportedly hopes to resume service substantially by the end of this week. Meanwhile, between 3% and 9% of gas stations in the three aforementioned states, as well as Florida, South Carolina and Tennessee, were reportedly without gasoline as of midday Tuesday. The news was covered on all sides. Some reports from left- and center-rated sources focused more on panic-buying as a potential irritant for the shortages. Right-rated outlets covered the news more prominently, often framing rising gas prices in the context of Biden's presidency and highlighting videos of apparent lines at gas stations across the southeastern U.S. Others on the right and elsewhere throughout the spectrum criticized a tweet from the New York Times (Lean Left bias) Monday morning saying "there have been no long lines" at gas stations; the Times' story has been updated with more context since Monday morning.

TITLE=> Bar Owner Charged With Murder During Nebraska Unrest Commits Suicide. ARTICLE=> A Nebraska bar owner who was indicted in the fatal shooting of a Black Lives Matter protester in May took his own life on Sunday. Jake Gardner was indicted by a grand jury on Sept. 15 in connection with the shooting of James Scurlock; the indictment came after Douglas County District Attorney Don Kleine cleared Gardner on June 1, saying he acted in self-defense after Scurlock attacked him. After Scurlock's family received enough signatures to to request the convening of a grand jury, the DA appointed special prosecutor Fred Franklin and a grand jury to the case. The jury's charges include manslaughter, using a firearm in the commission of a felony, and making terrorists threats. The story received more coverage from right-rated outlets, which tended to focus on Gardner's self-defense claim and emphasized the fact that Gardner was a veteran. Some right-rated outlets also highlighted Gardner's attorneys' claim that Gardner was experiencing "behavioral health concerns" after losing his bars and receiving death threats. Some left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight the fact that Gardner was white and Scurlock was black, using the phrase "white bar owner" in headlines. Editor's Note, 9/22/20 at 1:08 p.m. ET: Updated to include the fact that the DA initially found Scurlock to have physically assaulted Gardner.

TITLE=> FBI Director Compares Ransomware Challenge to 9/11. ARTICLE=> In a Thursday interview with The Wall Street Journal, FBI Director Christopher Wray compared the recent wave of ransomware cyberattacks to the challenge posed by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “The scale of this problem is one that I think the country has to come to terms with,” Wray said. The same day, Reuters reported that the Department of Justice would treat ransomware attacks with the same priority as terrorism, directing U.S. attorney’s offices to coordinate with a recently created task force in Washington, D.C. Additionally, the White House released an open letter urging businesses to take security measures against ransomware attacks. Coverage was generally balanced across the spectrum and split between Wray’s comments, the Reuters report and the White House letter.
TITLE=> FBI Confirm Nashville Bomber Anthony Warner Died In Explosion. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, the FBI confirmed suspect Anthony Warner as the culprit of an explosion that caused widespread damage in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning; U.S. Attorney Don Cochran said that Warner died in the explosion. The Nashville police department's hazardous devices unit was responding to reports of a suspicious RV when the vehicle exploded. Witnesses purportedly heard a warning coming from the vehicle saying, "Evacuate now... A bomb is in this vehicle and will explode." The impact injured three people and damaged 41 buildings, as well as communications systems across the state. On Saturday, Gov. Bill Lee asked the White House for federal assistance due to the "severity and magnitude" of the explosion. The Nashville sheriff's office said that police emergency systems across Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as Nashville's COVID-19 community hotline, are out of service due to an AT&T central office containing a telephone exchange and network equipment being affected by the blast. The explosion received coverage from all sides of the political spectrum. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the investigation and the impact of the blast. Some right-rated outlets highlighted the lack of fatalities and the police officers who cleared the area. This story was updated 12/27/20 at 3:30pm PT to include the FBI's confirmation of Warner as the suspect.

TITLE=> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Says More Stimulus Needed to Avoid ‘Tragic’ Consequences. ARTICLE=> Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell advocated for more economic stimulus on Tuesday, saying that “even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste.” Powell highlighted the danger of a prolonged economic recovery, which would create “recessionary dynamics” that exacerbate racial and wealth disparities. Powell also warned of a second wave of COVID-19, which would "more significantly limit economic activity,” and recommended following medical experts' guidance. Powell’s remarks received little original reporting in right-rated outlets. Left-rated outlets were more likely to cover Powell’s comments on racial and gender inequality. Some left- and center-rated outlets also mentioned Republicans’ support of a smaller stimulus package.
TITLE=> Trump Administration Says Formal Biden Transition Processes Can Begin. ARTICLE=> The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) told projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden Monday that the Trump administration would begin a transition of power by giving him access to necessary government materials. GSA Administration Emily Murphy wrote a letter to Biden outlining her decision and explaining her reasoning. President Donald Trump thanked Murphy in a tweet shortly after the news broke, while maintaining that his legal fight against purported pro-Biden election manipulation "STRONGLY continues." The news was covered by outlets on all sides of the spectrum, and was covered more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Florida Bans Critical Race Theory from Schools. ARTICLE=> The Florida State Board of Education unanimously voted to ban lessons that include critical race theory (CRT) from public schools Thursday. The board approved an amendment that prohibits the teaching that America is inherently racist, or "the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons." Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a video before the meeting that CRT distorts history, and urged board members, many who were appointed by DeSantis himself, to approve of the amendment that would teach student historical facts instead of “trying to indoctrinate them with ideology.” This comes after other states, such as Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Iowa, have put restrictions on CRT in classrooms. Critics of the theory say that students should not be taught that the U.S. is inherently racist, while advocates of CRT argue the U.S. was founded on stolen land and slave labor, and many of the country's institutions still uphold racism through laws and systems that favor white people over people of color. People on both of the argument also warn that narrowing acceptable classroom material could violate free speech.  Many on the left criticized DeSantis, calling the ban's language "vague" and arguing that the ban is aimed at avoiding analysis of ongoing racism. Right-rated outlets tended to focus on DeSantis' speech and the details of the amendment, and frame CRT in a negative light.

ARTICLE=> Officials from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services released a plan on Wednesday to distribute coronavirus vaccines to states within 24 hours of approval and at no cost to recipients. Distribution would prioritize populations like healthcare workers early on due to limited supply. Officials expect a vaccine to be ready by January 2021, although an earlier release is possible. Coverage in some left-rated outlets linked the administration's focus on rapid vaccine release to President Donald Trump's reelection efforts. Coverage in some right-rated outlets placed emphasis on the plan to distribute the vaccine free of charge.
TITLE=> President Trump Reportedly Interested in Buying Greenland. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has looked into acquiring Greenland, the world's largest island, reportedly to capitalize on its largely untapped land and natural resources. Media coverage from all sides of the political spectrum has framed the situation as interesting and peculiar; most reporting focused on whether or not the idea was a serious or achievable one, and also on the fact that Denmark foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger has said the island is "not for sale."
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rules Against 'Faithless Electors'. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday in favor of states who choose to punish so-called "faithless electors"; members of the Electoral College who break from the group of voters they represent. Faithless electors largely argued that their votes should be protected by free expression. Some faithless electors asked to skip the Electoral College process in favor of the popular vote. Some opponents of faithless electors warned of a possible oligopoly if those electors can break from common voters.
TITLE=> Twitter, Facebook Limit Sharing of New York Post Story about Joe Biden. ARTICLE=> Twitter and Facebook are limiting the distribution of the New York Post's story about emails purportedly suggesting that Joe Biden met with a top executive from Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company, while he was vice president. The companies are reportedly concerned the article contains false and/or questionable information. Biden's son Hunter served on Burisma's board from 2014 to 2019. Joe Biden has denied ever having conversations with Hunter related to his foreign business dealings. A Facebook communications executive said the site would limit distribution of the article and fact check it, while Twitter prevented the link from being shared in tweets or direct messages. Coverage from most left- and some center-rated sources focused more on the Post's piece, sometimes framing it as controversial and dubiously sourced. Right-rated outlets generally covered the limitations more prominently, often framing the moves from Twitter and Facebook as examples of unjust censorship. Some right-rated coverage focused on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's statement Thursday morning criticizing his company's handling of the article. Editor's note: Updated 10/15/20 at 11:23 a.m. to add more detail.

TITLE=> Trump Threatens Tariffs on France. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump threatened to place tariffs on French wine Friday via Twitter. The threat came after France introduced a new digital tax of three percent on all digital sales facilitated by multinational companies including Apple and Google. The French government has indicated that it would consider repealing the tax if a similar international tax was levied. Some left-leaning sources focused on Trump's perceived overuse of tariffs as a means for foreign trade negotiation. Some right-leaning media praised Trump for being tough on other countries who levy seemingly discriminatory tariffs against American companies.
TITLE=> New Jobless Claims Fall Below 1 Million. ARTICLE=> New filings for unemployment benefits in the U.S. numbered about 963,000 last week, falling below a million weekly claims for the first time since lockdowns began in March. In total, jobless claims topped one million for 21 weeks, with unemployment benefits accounting for about 5% of national income. Continuing unemployment claims dropped to 15.5 million. Some coverage from all sides, especially right-rated outlets, framed the drop in claims as indicative of a quickening recovery, pointing to a rallying stock market. Some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on the fact that the number of claims is still high by historical standards, and cautioned that many job losses could be permanent.
TITLE=> House Delays Vote on $1.2T Infrastructure Bill. ARTICLE=> A House of Representatives vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill was postponed Thursday night, as lawmakers continue to negotiate terms of President Joe Biden's larger $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package. Progressive Democrats have withheld support for the infrastructure bill unless Congress takes up the reconciliation bill, which covers "human infrastructure" and aims to bolster the country's social safety net. Some Centrist Democrats have opposed that bill's pricetag, and refuse to support it unless the price is reduced. The infrastructure vote was initially planned for Thursday but was delayed due to a lack of support from Democrats. Government funding for surface transportation programs ran out on Thursday, making an agreement on infrastructure funds vital. The House is scheduled to leave Washington D.C. for a two-week break at the end of this week. Coverage was similar and prominent across the spectrum. Many reports framed a quick agreement on the bill as unlikely and focused on the feud between the Democratic party's centrist and progressive wings. Some coverage also suggested that Biden's agenda is in jeopardy if the bill isn't passed and Democrats remain divided. 
TITLE=> Biden Signs $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Bill Into Law. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, titled the American Rescue Plan (ARP), Thursday afternoon. Congress gave its final approval the day before when the House passed the final version of the bill in a party-line vote. White House Secretary Jen Psaki previously told reporters that Biden would sign the bill on Friday, but tweeted Thursday morning: “Because Congress enrolled the bill more quickly than we anticipated, the President will sign the American Rescue Plan into law today within the hour. @VP will join him in the oval.” The White House also launched an official American Rescue Plan website, and Biden will give his first prime-time address to the nation Thursday evening. Coverage in some left-rated outlets focused on more positive descriptions of how the bill will "help the middle class." Coverage in some right-rated outlets focused on Republicans' criticisms of the bill, most notably for its size.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Hears High School Student's Free Speech Case. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments for a case which could impact free speech for American public school students. The case, Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L, centers around a then-high school sophomore who tried out for her school’s varsity cheerleading squad and didn’t make the team; soon after, the student posted an image of herself and a friend holding up their middle fingers to Snapchat, with an expletive-heavy caption. As punishment, the school's cheer coaches suspended the student from the cheerleading team for one year. The Pennsylvania school, backed by the Biden administration, argued the Supreme Court should allow schools to regulate students speech on social media when it becomes disruptive. American Civil Liberties Union lawyer David Cole, representing the student, argued educators should have no authority over student speech when they are not under a school’s supervision. The case could clarify the limits of the 1969 Supreme Court precedent that allows public schools to punish student speech when it "substantially disrupts" school. A decision is expected by June.  Outlets from the left and center tended to highlight the details of the case and provide analysis of the line justices must navigate between regulating free speech and leaving educators tools to deal with disruptive behavior. Some outlets on the right frame the Biden administration's backing of the school as support of censorship.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Refuses to Halt NY Subpoena for Trump Tax Records. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court denied an October 2020 request by former President Donald Trump to block Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance from enforcing a 2019 subpoena for Trump’s financial records. The decision, released along with several others on Monday, paved the way for a New York grand jury to privately review tax return records that Trump had long refused to release publicly. The court also rejected appeals from Trump and Republicans over contested 2020 voting rules, as well as an appeal from porn star Stormy Daniels in a defamation case against the former president. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to feature this story more prominently than right-rated outlets, which were less likely to have original reporting on the tax records decision. Coverage tended to follow similar narratives regardless of source. Several outlets from across the spectrum published separate articles on the other high-profile court decisions.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's First 100 Days. ARTICLE=> The first 100 days of Joe Biden’s presidency, a milestone he will reach this week, were largely about fighting the coronavirus and stimulating the domestic economy. Media outlets from the right, left and center give their take on how well Biden delivered on a mission he defined on Inauguration Day to "repair," "restore," "heal" and "build."  Most agreed that he met many of his promises on COVID-19, climate change, and the economy, but that solving the immigration crisis and achieving bipartisanship are still unmet goals.

TITLE=> Federal Watchdog Determines White House Broke Law By Freezing Ukraine Aid. ARTICLE=> The Government Accountability Office, an independent, non-partisan watchdog agency that provides auditing and investigative services for Congress, found this week that President Donald Trump's administration violated federal law when it withheld aid to Ukraine. In a report released Thursday, the office concluded that a 1974 law governing budgeting procedures "does not permit OMB (Office of Management and Budget) to withhold funds for policy reasons" and that the constitution "grants the president no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation." Outlets on both sides of the aisle highlighted the timing and significance of the ruling, which came hours before lawmakers were set to be sworn in for Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate. Many also included a response from OMB, which disagreed with the determination.

ARTICLE=> A Department of Homeland Security report concluded that China hid the extreme nature of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in order to build a domestic medical supply stockpile. Some reports concentrated on the fact that the report described itself as having been compiled in "moderate confidence." Many right-rated outlets also focused on potential tariffs and other trade measures the U.S. could impose as a potential "punishment" for China. Some left-rated voices argued that the DHS report still doesn't explain President Trump's purported failure to act quickly in response to the outbreak.
TITLE=> NYT Report Says FEMA Projects Higher Death Tolls; White House Pushes Back. ARTICLE=> A New York Times report released Monday details Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) projections that estimate up to 3,000 daily COVID-19 coronavirus deaths by June. The White House press corps responded by saying the projections have yet to be vetted by the Coronavirus Task Force, and that public health remains President Donald Trump's "top priority." Media coverage differed vastly along partisan lines. Some reports, particularly from left-rated sources, focused on the multiple death toll revisions issued by the president and other federal health officials since the start of the pandemic. Other sources throughout the spectrum, especially on the right, placed more focus on questions regarding the FEMA projections. One scientist who helped create the projection reportedly said the modeling was incomplete.
TITLE=> Trump Says He Will Formally Cancel NAFTA, Putting Pressure on Congress to Pass New Deal. ARTICLE=> President Trump said that he will move to formally cancel the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), putting pressure on Congress to ratify his new pact with Canada and Mexico which several Democrats have criticized.
TITLE=> Antiviral Drug Remdesivir Approved as COVID-19 Treatment by FDA. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences, as a treatment for COVID-19 Thursday. The drug, sold under the name Veklury, will be used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Previously authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19, it has become the first FDA-approved treatment for the virus. Typically administered in five doses through an IV, remdesivir has shown to shorten recovery time by working to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, a World Health Organization (WHO) study has found that four drugs, including remdesivir, have no effect in curing the virus. President Donald Trump was administered remdesivir along with several other drugs during his bout with the virus earlier this month. The news has been covered similarly by outlets from across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Flynn Under Investigation for Plan to Kidnap Turkish Dissident. ARTICLE=> Michael Flynn, Donald Trump's former national security advisor, is currently under investigation for allegedly planning to kidnap a Turkish Muslim religious leader living in the United States and send him to an isolated prison in Turkey in exchange for $15 million.
TITLE=> Storm Harvey Threatens Louisiana.

TITLE=> Senate Passes Criminal Justice Bill. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate has passed the First Step Act to address concerns that America locks up too many people for non-violent crimes.
TITLE=> Intel Officials Warn of Possible Russian Interference in 2020 Election. ARTICLE=> Officials have warned members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia intends to interfere in the upcoming election in support of President Donald Trump. Trump reportedly expressed his displeasure with intelligence community officers for disclosing this information to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), lead House manager in the president's impeachment trial. Some left-leaning voices focused on potential evidence of the reports and speculated about the consequences of Russian interference in US elections. Some right-leaning sources pushed back on the seriousness of the claims.
TITLE=> Biden Reopens ACA Health Care Enrollment. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden signed an executive order Thursday to reopen healthcare insurance enrollment starting Feb. 15. The new enrollment period is set to last for 90 days on Healthcare.gov, which services 36 states; the 14 states that manage their own health marketplaces may follow suit soon. This reverses some of the policies of former President Donald Trump and restores the Obama-era Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid. Biden said his actions are meant to “undo the damage" that Trump, who repeatedly attempted to repeal the ACA, has done; Biden's order also compels other federal agencies to reexamine Trump-era policies regarding both the ACA and Medicaid. The ACA provides health insurance to more than 23 million people; the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 15 million Americans lack insurance and would be eligible for marketplace coverage. On Thursday Biden also issued a memorandum to revoke the Mexico City Policy, or the "global gag rule," which blocks assistance to groups that include abortion services or information in family planning programs. Coverage from left- and center-outlets analyzed how the order may expand healthcare access for the uninsured. Some right-rated outlets focused on the legal battle Trump waged throughout his term in an effort to repeal the ACA. Right-rated outlets also tended to highlight Biden's reversal of the global gag rule.
TITLE=> Florida House Declares Porn a Public Health Risk. ARTICLE=> The Florida House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a bill that declares pornography a public health risk. The move drew some criticism from the media after the legislature declined to debate a ban on assault weapons hours prior.
TITLE=> Troubles Continue for Steve Bannon. ARTICLE=> Bannon's troubles continue as allies drift and prominent donors take sides.
TITLE=> Trial Begins for Former Officer Charged With George Floyd's Death. ARTICLE=> The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, began on Monday. In his opening statement, prosecutor Jerry Blackwell argued that “Chauvin betrayed this badge when he used excessive and unreasonable force upon the body of Mr. George Floyd.” Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, argued that “Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over the course of his 19-year career. The use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing.” Chauvin’s charges include second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Outlets on all sides of the spectrum prominently featured coverage of the trial; left-rated outlets were more likely to feature “live updates” coverage. As of Monday afternoon, coverage focused on similar events in the trial regardless of bias rating.
TITLE=> Health Experts Say Pro-Biden Celebrations May Have Been 'Superspreader' Events. ARTICLE=> Large celebrations following the media's projection of Joe Biden as the 46th U.S. president may have spread the COVID-19 coronavirus, according to health experts and epidemiologists who voiced concern about the lack of social distancing at the demonstrations. Thousands of people congregated in the streets this past weekend in major cities across the United States after multiple major networks projected the election for Biden on Saturday; amid an apparent resurgence of the virus, the U.S. has reportedly recorded 1 million new cases since the start of November. The public health concerns about the celebrations were covered more by right-rated media outlets, with few reports from left- and center-rated outlets. Some coverage accused Biden and left-rated media of hypocrisy for allegedly focusing too much on apparent super spreader events at the Trump White House and not enough on the apparent public safety implications of last weekend's celebrations.
TITLE=> Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level Since March 2020. ARTICLE=> Americans filed 576,000 initial jobless claims last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday, falling to their lowest level since March 2020. While this is still above the levels of around 220,000 that prevailed before the coronavirus hit the U.S. economy, the economy is showing signs of improvement as vaccination rates power consumer spending, governments relax restrictions on businesses, and federal-stimulus funds flow through the economy.
TITLE=> Theresa May in Peril. ARTICLE=> Theresa May is under pressure to resign as Prime Minister after a stunning election loss where the Conservatives lost their majority in Parliament.
TITLE=> Protesters Attempt to Topple Statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.

TITLE=> Biden Picks Miguel Cardona for Education Secretary. ARTICLE=> President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Connecticut Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona for Secretary of Education. Cardona is also a former elementary school teacher, principal and assistant superintendent. If confirmed, Cardona would likely work to resume in-classroom learning, which Biden has said he plans to do within his first 100 days in office. Cardona advocated for reopening schools in Connecticut and worked to purchase devices for students participating in remote learning. Cardona is also the third Latino selected for Biden's cabinet, continuing Biden's prioritization of diversity in building his administration. Some coverage from across the spectrum compared Cardona to current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, with some coverage in left-rated outlets comparing Cardona and DeVos' different socioeconomic upbringings. Coverage in right-rated outlets was more likely to discuss Cardona's history with teachers unions, including the American Federation of Teachers.
TITLE=> Facing Retaliation from Taliban, First Afghan Evacuees Arrive in US. ARTICLE=> Roughly 200 Afghan interpreters and their families arrived in the United States early Friday, the first group of evacuees who aided the American war effort in Afghanistan and now face retaliation from the Taliban. The evacuees will complete a special visa application process created following the end of U.S. military operations in the country earlier this month. About 2,500 people will be taken to the U.S. as part of the program, and another 4,000 will reportedly be evacuated to third countries or overseas U.S. military bases. The Taliban has reportedly already begun targeting and executing people accused of helping the U.S. military. 	There were few notable divides in coverage across the spectrum. Most sources laid out the facts with little to no spin or slant, regardless of their bias rating; many put a special focus on the dangers the interpreters face back home.
TITLE=> Net Neutrality Rules Officially Expire. ARTICLE=> Net neutrality rules officially expired on Monday, which compelled internet service providers to give equal access to all content online. Supporters of the move emphasize that the regulations were fairly new and that internet usage functioned well in the years prior to their implementation.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Trump Hasn't Yet Conceded the Election. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has not yet conceded the 2020 presidential election to projected winner Joe Biden. Multiple major media outlets have declared Biden the race's winner, and he's widely expected to be elected the 46th president; Trump has claimed the election was manipulated against him, and he and other Republicans have filed lawsuits alleging voter fraud and vote-counting discrepancies in several states. Voices throughout the spectrum have focused on Trump's attitudes toward the election's current state. Many, especially left-rated voices, have criticized Trump and the Republican Party for purportedly assaulting democratic values by not conceding. A Wall Street Journal editorial from Trump's former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney lays out the president's ostensible intention to "act and speak like a great president should—win or lose," once all outstanding litigation is resolved. Election law and claims of voter fraud have been a significant focus of fact-checkers on the left, right and center.
TITLE=> Americans Are Dying Younger. ARTICLE=> People are dying younger in the United States than in other wealthy countries, according to a recently published study on life expectancy and mortality rates. The average American's life expectancy decreased from 78.9 in 2014 to 78.6 in 2017, which is the last year covered in the report. Most coverage, regardless of political leaning, concentrated on mortality's apparent across-the-board spike, attributing it to reported increases in suicides, drug overdoses and addiction-related diseases.
TITLE=> Death Toll Rises In Europe As Floodwaters Diminish. ARTICLE=> The death toll has continued to rise and hundreds are still missing in Europe after record rainfall produced some of the largest floods the continent has seen in centuries. Germany and Belgium were the main countries damaged by the floodwaters, while Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands also experienced heavy rainstorms over the past few days. Buildings were destroyed, cars were crushed and more than 100,000 homes were left without power. As the floodwaters recede, rescue crews have been deployed and are searching for survivors. Many European leaders have listed climate change as the cause of the extreme weather.  Many left-leaning outlets highlighted the natural disaster’s connection to climate change. Most right-leaning outlets did not highlight climate change in their reporting.
TITLE=> Biden Says He Is 'Not a Fan' of Court Packing. ARTICLE=> In an interview with WKRC Local 12, a Cincinnati TV station, presidential candidate Joe Biden said he is “not a fan of court packing,” but that “I want to keep focused. The president would love nothing better than to fight about whether or not I would, in fact, pack the court or not pack the court.” Biden also echoed assertions from other Democrats that the appointments of Amy Coney Barrett and other conservative judges amounted to court packing, saying, “That’s the court packing the public should be focused on.” Coverage in some right-rated outlets framed Biden’s response as a continuation of “dodging questions” on court packing. Coverage in left- and center- rated outlets framed Biden’s response as breaking with a trend of evading questions on the subject.
TITLE=> Trump Reverses Course on Stimulus, Urges Congressional Approval. ARTICLE=> After accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of "not negotiating [a new coronavirus stimulus deal] in good faith" and saying he told aides to stop negotiations, President Donald Trump tweeted late Tuesday that "House & Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, & 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business." The Trump administration and Congressional Democrats had been locked in a stalemate over the price tag for a new bill; negotiations had been scheduled to continue Tuesday after the House of Representatives passed a $2.2 trillion proposal earlier this week. Some reports from left-rated sources framed Trump's comments and reversal as erratic. Some coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated more on Trump's criticisms of Pelosi and Democrats.
TITLE=> Democratic Leaders Seek $500 Billion in Next Round of Coronavirus Relief Plan. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will seek at least $50 billion in the next round of coronavirus stimulus, double what the Trump Administration is asking. The measure would include funding for coronavirus testing, medical equipment, state and local government assistance, and food stamps.
TITLE=> CNN Alleges Trump Violated Military Guidelines by Signing MAGA Hats in Iraq, Drawing Scrutiny From Right-Leaning Sources. ARTICLE=> CNN alleged that President Trump violated military guidelines by signing MAGA hats for troops during his Iraq visit. Many right-leaning publications have criticized the reports as biased and accused the network of holding Trump to a double standard.
TITLE=> Sanders Wins in New Hampshire with 26%, then Buttigieg 24%, Klobuchar 20%. ARTICLE=> New Hampshire primary results: Bernie Sanders wins in close election over Pete Buttigieg with Amy Klobuchar an unexpectedly strong third. All other candidates fell far behind the top three with Elizabeth Warren at 9% and Biden at 8%, Tom Steyer and the rest win less than 4% each. Andrew Yang drops out of the race. Commentary congratulates Sanders with some pointing out the fact that his home state is next door and that this is a much smaller victory margin than what he earned over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Coverage across the spectrum portrayed Sanders as winning the left side of the party with Buttigieg and Klobuchar battling over moderates. The right often emphasized his Democratic Socialist party affiliation, with Fox News on cable running the headline "Socialist Wins New Hampshire". All agree the results were bad news for Elizabeth Warren. It was also a poor showing for Joe Biden who was in South Carolina pointing out, as many pundits did, that the race is still very young and these two states don't add up to much.
TITLE=> House Approves Disaster Aid, Debt Limit. ARTICLE=> The House approved a package of $15.25 billion in relief for victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as a three-month extension of the government’s funding and borrowing limit.
TITLE=> Trump Criticizes Democrats for "Medicare For All" Proposal. ARTICLE=> President Trump criticizes Democrats for proposing "Medicare For All" in a USA Today Op-ed.
TITLE=> Analysis: Bernie Sanders and Medicare for All. ARTICLE=> Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) plan for 'Medicare-for-all' was the subject of scrutiny during and following Tuesday's democratic presidential debate in South Carolina. Media outlets on all sides of the spectrum have focused on analysis of the plan, its plausibility, projected reach and estimated price-tag, as well as concentrating coverage on the ongoing internal debate between moderate and progressive Democrats. Some have fact-checked false or misleading claims made on social media about Medicare-for-all.
TITLE=> Congress Averts Government Shutdown, Nears COVID-19 Relief Deal. ARTICLE=> Congress passed a two-day stopgap measure Friday to avoid a midnight government shutdown, as negotiations continue over a COVID-19 relief bill. The House of Representatives passed the stopgap with a 320-60 vote, and the Senate unanimously approved it shortly after; President Donald Trump must now offer his final approval. Lawmakers will reconvene Sunday afternoon about possibly attaching a $900 billion stimulus package to the $1.4 trillion bill that officially funds the government. Congressional leaders on both sides previously said they would through the weekend if necessary. Coverage in some left-rated outlets was less optimistic about a deal, with some juxtaposing coverage of congressional negotiations with coverage of Americans’ deepening economic struggles. Coverage in right-rated outlets was sparser and focused more on the negotiations. Updated 12/18/20 at 7:59 p.m. ET
TITLE=> Texas Gov. Abbott Bans All Texas Businesses From Mandating Vaccinations. ARTICLE=> Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Monday issued an executive order banning any business or person in Texas from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for employees or customers.  “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,” Abbott said in a statement. Abbott also urged the state legislature to pass a similar law replacing the executive order; the order states that “No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine by any individual, including an employee or a consumer, who objects to such vaccination for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.” 	Coverage was prominent across the spectrum. Coverage from left-rated outlets sometimes highlighted Abbott's previous opposition to banning vaccine mandates, and framed him as being under pressure from other Republicans to be tougher against the Biden administration's purportedly overbearing COVID-19 guidelines. Reports from right-rated sources were often more brief and focused only on the order's details.
TITLE=> Poll: Most Mexicans want to deport unauthorized migrants. ARTICLE=> A Washington Post poll suggests that 55 percent of Mexicans support deporting United States-bound migrants from Mexico. All sides of the media related their poll results coverage to growing scrutiny of Mexico and how it handles migrants heading for the U.S.
TITLE=> Democrat Conor Lamb Claims Victory in Pennsylvania. ARTICLE=> Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory after a cliffhanger Pennsylvania election for a congressional district that Donald Trump won by 20 points two years ago.
TITLE=> Polarization Distorts Views of Hydroxychloroquine, Healthcare. ARTICLE=> Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug once touted by President Donald Trump as a potential COVID-19 coronavirus cure, remains a point of contention more than four months into the pandemic. This week, Trump and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro each defended their support for the drug to reporters. Some officials are pushing for more investment and research into hydroxychloroquine; others worry that focusing on the drug could crowd out investment into other potential COVID-19 treatments. The hydroxychloroquine controversy has been covered by news outlets on all sides. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed Trump administration support for the drug as questionable. Coverage of the drug's effectiveness is more nuanced, as journalists attempt to explain complex medical studies. However, evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine tends to be found in right-rated outlets, while evidence against the drug tends to be found in left-rated outlets.
TITLE=> House Democrats Launch Trump Probe. ARTICLE=> House Democrats launched a broad probe into President Trump on Monday, requesting documents from 81 agencies and individuals as they investigate his business dealings, interactions with Russia, and possible obstruction of justice.
TITLE=> Contradictory Data Fuels Split Narratives on Economy, Inflation. ARTICLE=> Recent data about inflation, wages and poverty is driving confusion about the state of the U.S. economy. The Labor Department announced Tuesday that consumer prices rose 0.3% in August from July, another monthly rise but the slowest increase since January; consumer prices also rose annually again in August, up 5.3%. Producer prices rose in August by 8.3% annually, the highest jump since records began in 2009. Meanwhile, poverty reached a record low in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Roughly 9.1% of Americans qualified as poor in 2020 according to the Census Bureau, down from 11.8% in 2019 and the lowest figure since records began in 1967. Average earnings for non-farm employees also rose in August for the fifth consecutive month, but inflation counteracts some of that — wages adjusted for inflation fell 0.5% annually in August, according to the Wall Street Journal. And despite the record-high 10.9 million U.S. job openings at the end of July, the economy remains over 5 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic workforce. The 235,000 jobs added in August were short of expectations. Left-rated sources focused more on the decline in poverty, often framing it as a direct result of the trillions of dollars of pandemic-era stimulus from the federal government. Right-rated outlets, as well as business-focused center-rated outlets like the Wall Street Journal, instead highlighted inflation and rises in consumer prices, as well as concerns about high government spending and generous federal unemployment benefits.
TITLE=> Study Examines Pfizer's COVID-19 Vaccine Against Infection, Hospitalization Over Time. ARTICLE=> A study published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet Monday says that Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine loses effectiveness over time but remains strong in preventing severe COVID-19 cases. According to the study, which was funded by Pfizer, the vaccine's effectiveness against infection falls from 88% in the first month after inoculation to 47% after five months. However, the study says Pfizer's vaccine remains 90% effective after six months in preventing hospitalization against all COVID-19 variants, including Delta. Researchers analyzed health records of more than 3.4 million people for the study. Last month, the CDC recommended Pfizer's COVID-19 booster shot for people ages 65 and older, and for adults at high risk of severe COVID-19. Many reports from left-rated outlets highlighted the fact that protection against hospitalization remains strong over time. Conversely, some reports from right-rated outlets highlighted the significant drop-off in the vaccine's effectiveness against infection. Right-rated website Project Veritas published videos Monday that claim to show a Pfizer scientist saying that "antibodies are probably better than the vaccination" for people who had COVID-19 previously.
TITLE=> 26 Million Americans Seek Unemployment Benefits. ARTICLE=> A record 26 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks, as the coronavirus pandemic continues. The Labor Department reported that 4.4 million more people filed jobless claims for the first time last week, down from 5.2 million the week before.
TITLE=> Court Upholds Block on Travel Ban. ARTICLE=> The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday to uphold in large part the Hawaiian court's decision to block President Trump's travel ban.
TITLE=> U.S. Weekly Jobless Claims Surge to More Than 3 Million. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to more than 3 million last week as layoffs continued in the wake of the coronavirus spread. The sharp rise in claims signals the unemployment rate could rise several percentage points in coming months, after matching a 50-year low of 3.5% in February.
TITLE=> Obama Lawyers Send Cease-And-Desist Letter to Pro-Trump Super PAC. ARTICLE=> Lawyers for former President Barack Obama (D-IL) sent a cease-and-desist letter to a pro-Trump super PAC, saying the group misused a quote from Obama's book to paint former Vice President and 2020 hopeful Joe Biden (D- DE) in a negative light. The advertisement ran in South Carolina, which holds its Democratic primary on Saturday. Obama spokeswoman and former congresswoman Katie Hill described the advertisement as "designed to suppress turnout among minority voters." A lawyer for the PAC defended the advertisement as "absolutely accurate and truthful and correct" in a statement to NBC News.
TITLE=> House Passes George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act on Wednesday in a party-line vote, with two moderate Democrats voting against it. The bill would ban chokeholds and alter qualified immunity for law enforcement nationwide. While one Republican—Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX)—voted for the bill, he later tweeted that he had “accidentally pressed the wrong voting button and realized it too late.” The House passed a similar bill in 2020, but Senate Democrats will still need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a Senate filibuster. The Biden administration previously announced its support for the bill in a statement released Monday. News coverage in right-rated outlets was less common and highlighted the bill’s party-line vote. Some right-rated outlets also published analysis and opinion articles criticizing the bill. While coverage in left- and center-rated outlets did mention the party-line vote, most headlines simply said the “House” passed the bill.
TITLE=> 2nd Amendment Activists Rally Against Gun Control Legislation in Virginia. ARTICLE=> A rally at the Virginia Capitol on Monday ended peacefully after an estimated 22,000 gun owners and gun rights activists demonstrated in protest of proposed state gun control legislation. Some reporting and voices focused on the peacefulness of the rally compared to the deadly Charlottesville incident in 2017; others focused on sightings of suspected white supremacists and members of other extremist sects at the rally. Some, particularly on the right, criticized the media for alleged fear-mongering leading up to the demonstration.

TITLE=> Former Florida Governor Candidate Gillum Found With Drugs in Miami Hotel. ARTICLE=> Former Tallahassee mayor and Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum became the subject of intense media scrutiny over the weekend after he was found in a hotel room on Friday with bags of suspected crystal meth. The Democrat, who in 2018 came just 34,000 votes away from winning the state's highest office, was in Miami when police discovered him inebriated and in the company of a man who had reportedly overdosed on the drugs. Gillum has since issued a statement in which he apologized for the "distraction" and denied that he had used the substance himself. Coverage of the news has ranged from straightforward to sensational, with some right and center-rated outlets focusing heavily on the incident's illicit nature.
TITLE=> Reports Say Netanyahu Secretly Met With Saudi Crown Prince, Saudis Deny Meeting Happened. ARTICLE=> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secretly met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, according to reports from Israeli media and anonymous Saudi government advisers. The meeting was also reportedly attended by Mossad chief Yossi Cohen and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had visited Israel the week before. On Monday, Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan denied the meeting with Netanyahu took place, saying, “No such meeting occurred. The only officials present were American and Saudi.” Coverage in some left-rated outlets placed greater emphasis on implications for Palestine and mentioned Pompeo’s recent visit to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Coverage in some center- and right-rated outlets placed greater emphasis on the involved countries’ opposition to Iran.
TITLE=> DOJ Not Charging NYPD Officer in Eric Garner Case. ARTICLE=> The Department of Justice has announced that it will not be charging an NYPD officer in the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Tomorrow marks the fifth anniversary of Garner's death, which occurred after a physical struggle with the officer. The decision cited the lack of solid evidence against the officer, saying his actions were not the sole cause of Garner's death. Some on the left side of the media paint the decision as being a political statement rather than an objectively legal one; much of the right side of the media is focusing on case and legal facts that favor the officer.
TITLE=> Trump Heads to Kenosha, Wisconsin. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump heads to Kenosha, Wisconsin Tuesday to highlight a law and order theme in a city that has experienced protests and violence after the shooting of a black man by a white police officer. The trip is in defiance of Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, who asked Trump to stay away to calm the tensions. Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden has also condemned Trump for defending a young Trump supporter who allegedly fatally shot two protesters in Kenosha last week.
TITLE=> Senate Rules Committee to Consider Election Overhaul Bill. ARTICLE=> The Senate Rules Committee will meet on Tuesday to markup S.1, a Democrat-backed elections bill that would change the federal government's role in elections.  The bill would override laws such as the ones emerging in Georgia and Florida that require photos IDs to vote, and would expand mail-in voting and in-person voting hours. S.1., also called "The Peoples Act," faces Republican opposition and some Democrat reservations, so the pathway to Senate passage appears to be uncertain.
TITLE=> Rose McGowan Likens Democrats, GOP To a 'Cult' in Fox News Interview. ARTICLE=> Actress Rose McGowan said the Democratic Party is a "cult" on a Fox News appearance Monday. McGowan, best known for her acting career and for being a pioneering advocate for the #MeToo movement, said being raised in a cult gave her "the ability to see the control and the propaganda machine" in the U.S. "I do believe Democrats, most especially, are in a deep cult that they really don't know about and aren't really aware of," McGowan said, adding that Democrats are for "a system that is for so few people and benefits so few, but they masquerade as the helpers—we would do this, the world would be perfect if only those Republicans would get out of the way." After receiving criticism from the left for her interview, McGowan responded on Twitter, saying the interview caused a "cognitive dissonance" from someone who previously considered herself a Democrat, and that, "The fact that Fox News let someone like me on...is pretty f---ing extraordinary." McGowan also said that while she received backlash for calling Democrats a cult, she also said the same about the Republican Party during her interview. McGowan's interview received coverage across the political spectrum. Critics on the left pushed back against McGowan's initial interview, with some saying that Fox News "used" McGowan. On  Tuesday, Fox News host Rachel Campos-Duffy praised McGowan for speaking openly.
TITLE=> Jair Bolsonaro Wins Presidential Election in Brazil. ARTICLE=> Right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election on Sunday, ending a highly controversial and violent campaign. Bolsonaro has been lauded by some for his commitment to fighting crime and furthering conservative economic ideals, while others have said that his support for lethal force against suspected criminals will violate civil liberties and that his policies will damage the environment. He has also received backlash for his divisive rhetoric, which  included insults towards women, blacks, and the LGBT community.

TITLE=> Donald Trump's Second Impeachment Trial Begins. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial began in the Senate Tuesday afternoon. Trump is charged with inciting a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol and obstruct the confirmation of President Joe Biden’s election win; the Capitol breach on Jan. 6 event led to the deaths of six people. House impeachment managers called Trump’s alleged actions “the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a President”; Trump’s defense has argued the case was unconstitutional, calling it “political theater.”  Senators voted 56-44 to proceed with the trial Tuesday after the impeachment managers, a team of nine House Democrats, presented senators with graphic images and video of the violence at the Capitol. Updated 2/9/21 at 6:42 p.m. ET
TITLE=> Harris Breaks Tie to Begin Senate Talks On COVID-19 Stimulus. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, Senate Democrats voted to begin debate surrounding the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 bill. The Senate voted 50-50 to advance the bill with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie; no Republicans voted to take up the bill. This comes after a delay in approval from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which would make sure the Senate's bill complied with reconciliation rules -- a budget process that allows the bill to bypass a 60-vote filibuster. The Senate's version of the bill removes the $15 minimum wage increase, and lowers the cutoff for receiving stimulus checks to $80,000 for individuals and $160,000 for couples. The Senate will likely debate the bill for several days before it reaches a final vote. Then, the bill will return to the House, which will need to approve any changes made by the Senate. The Senate's decision received coverage across the political spectrum.

TITLE=> Pennsylvania High Court Rejects Bid to Halt Election Certification. ARTICLE=> On Saturday, Pennsylvania's highest court rejected a lower court's order blocking the state from certifying the state's 2020 presidential election results. The challenge, led by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), claimed  the state's mail-in voting law was unconstitutional. It was thrown out by the state's Supreme Court, which said the underlying lawsuit was filed months after the law allowed for challenges to Pennsylvania's year-old mail-in voting law. This comes a day after a federal appeals court in Philadelphia rejected the Trump campaign’s effort to challenge the state’s election results. The story was covered by media outlets across the political spectrum.

TITLE=> Congressional Races, Finances Come Under Microscope as Competition Tightens. ARTICLE=> Races for congressional seats are reportedly tightening throughout the country, and coming under more scrutiny as election season heats up. The races could have broad implications on partisan control of the U.S. government; as of now, the Senate holds a 53-45 Republican-to-Democrat majority, and the House of Representatives holds a 232-197 Democrat-to-Republican majority. Reports on all sides of the spectrum have focused on specific and potentially tight races, as well as campaign finances and donations for Republicans and Democrats alike. Some reports, particularly from from left-rated outlets, have focused on the notion that Republicans are in great danger of losing the Senate majority. Coverage from some right-rated sources has concentrated more on campaign funding, such as which PACs are supporting Republican candidates, and which groups seem to be fueling Democratic campaigns.
TITLE=> House Judiciary Approves Impeachment Articles. ARTICLE=> This post was updated at 10:20 a.m. EST The House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump Friday morning, making a full House vote on impeaching the president likely to happen next week. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) had ended a 14-hour hearing on impeachment articles Thursday shortly before midnight, asking members on both sides to "search their consciences" before casting final votes on the articles Friday. Reports from around the spectrum focused on apparent outrage from Republicans, who accused Nadler of delaying the hearing for television purposes, and from Democrats, who believed GOP members were trying to keep the hearing out of the normal news cycle.

ARTICLE=> The U.S. K-12 education system is under the microscope, as schools begin classes and sort out how to pursue learning in the midst of COVID-19 coronavirus restrictions. Some schools will start the year completely virtual — others will alternate between in-person and at-home learning. Certain states have already elected to enact quarantines and re-close some schools early on in the experiment. Other states and state leaders are working to quell concerns and strive toward normalcy in classrooms while keeping schools open. Some coverage focused on how families will balance work with at-home learning; some voices explored potential alternatives to public schools, arguing that teaching effectiveness will decrease and that low-income families will be especially affected by school instability this fall. Others concentrated on how to keep kids focused when learning from home.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Critical Race Theory in Schools. ARTICLE=> Critical race theory (CRT) and how it's taught in classrooms is at the center of debate nationwide. At least 21 states have introduced or passed legislation to restrict or ban the teaching of CRT. Several videos of tense debates over CRT at school board meetings have recently gone viral. There's a partisan divide not only on applying the theory, but also on how it evolved over time, what it represents, and how it could influence students.  Supporters of critical race theory being taught in schools say it's a necessary academic tool for "examining how racism is embedded in America’s laws and institutions", and argue that attempts to suppress it represent a "Republican scare tactic and disinformation campaign." Opponents of critical race theory in schools argue that it trains people to only "see everything through the lens of racial group identity and inherited guilt"; some called for "more grassroots involvement in ensuring that schools teach American history and values with fairness and accuracy." CRT supporters often describe it as a positive after-effect of the civil rights movement; opponents often say it has Marxist roots and is anti-American.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Remote Learning vs. In-Person Classrooms. ARTICLE=> As summer heats up, so does the debate surrounding remote learning and in-person classrooms. Johns Hopkins University estimates that 45.7% of Americans are fully vaccinated, while many states have dropped mask mandates and safety restrictions for the vaccinated or dropped mask mandates altogether. Several school districts in Texas, Florida and New York have decided to end remote learning altogether; elsewhere, schools will keep online learning programs as options for families who want to continue remote education.  Some in favor of keeping a remote learning option claim online school leads to students experiencing less racism. Others say that remote learning keeps students from black and brown communities safer from the virus, since they argue these students may have less access to the vaccines. Those in favor of in-person schooling point to data showing that many students fell behind in the year of remote learning; others point out that students in more remote or underserved areas lacked access to the internet and technology needed for remote schooling. Some in the middle argue that the debate has become politically charged; they point out that different students have different learning behaviors and needs, and that both remote and in-person learning can be beneficial in different situations.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden and Press Conferences. ARTICLE=> Bipartisan calls are mounting for President Joe Biden to hold his first solo press conference since he took office on Jan. 20. During his time as president, Biden has sat for several one-on-one interviews, done a CNN town hall, made several prepared speeches and announcements, and answered a few questions from reporters at events, but the president has yet to hold a press conference. Biden is the first president in the past four decades to go this far into his administration without holding a formal press conference with reporters. Some say press conferences are critical to informing the American people and holding an administration accountable to the public. Others say reporters are responsible for pressuring Biden to hold a news conference. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that President Joe Biden would hold a press conference by the end of the month. Voices from across the political spectrum, from the Washington Post editorial board to former White House Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, have called for Biden to hold a press conference. Voices from the right tend to highlight Biden's past "gaffes" during speeches as a potential reason why he has yet to hold a press conference; others compared Biden's media strategy to former President Donald Trump's, who often used Twitter to address Americans directly.
TITLE=> Third Woman Accuses Brett Kavanaugh of Sexual Misconduct, Says He Drugged and Assaulted Women in High School. ARTICLE=> A third woman has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying in a sworn declaration that he drugged girls in high school so that they could be assaulted.

TITLE=> House Releases Resolution Describing Impeachment Inquiry Process.

The resolution, initially filed by House Rules Committee chair Jim McGovern (D-MA), followed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Monday statement that the House would hold a full vote on how to move forward with the impeachment probe, which is expected to happen Thursday. Most reporting outlets are linking to the full text of the resolution in their coverage. Some right-leaning sources focused coverage on GOP criticisms of the process in addition to the announcement.
TITLE=> DOJ Election Crimes Official Resigns. ARTICLE=> Richard Pilger, director of the Election Crimes branch of the Department of Justice, has resigned from his post. The move comes after Attorney General William Barr authorized Pilger to probe specific allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Pilger is claiming that Barr's directive goes against the 40-year-old Non-Interference Policy for ballot fraud investigations prior to election certification.
TITLE=> Death of Mollie Tibbetts Sparks Debate on Immigration. ARTICLE=> The death of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts has reignited a national debate on illegal immigration after an undocumented immigrant was arrested for her murder.

TITLE=> Alabama Amazon Workers Vote Against Unionizing. ARTICLE=> Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama voted 1,798 to 738 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), the National Labor Relations Board announced Friday. The vote was the first formal attempt to unionize by workers at the online retail giant that employs over 950,000 Americans, pays workers at least $15 per hour and is known for intense working conditions. Amazon took several anti-union actions leading up to the Bessemer vote, including sending near-daily texts urging workers to vote no, holding mandatory anti-union meetings and attempting to ban mail-in ballots for the vote; the RWDSU has raised objections that these actions "interfered with the employees' freedom of choice," potentially invalidating the vote. Coverage was relatively similar across the spectrum but was featured less prominently on homepages of right-rated outlets and some left-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Fauci, Paul Debate Over NIH Funding of Wuhan Lab. ARTICLE=> During a Senate Health Committee hearing on Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) debated Dr. Anthony Fauci on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) funding of research at a lab in Wuhan, China. In May, Paul claimed that the NIH funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV); then, Fauci responded that the NIH “has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” On Tuesday, Paul repeated his claims, pointing to an academic research paper by WIV published in 2017 that cited the NIH as a resource, and implying that Fauci lied to Congress in May. Fauci responded Tuesday that the paper was evaluated and judged by staff as "not being gain-of-function," saying “I totally resent the lie you are now propagating."  The story was covered by outlets across the political spectrum, who focused on the claims by both Paul and Fauci. Right-rated outlets tended to frame Paul as being in the right; left-rated outlets often did the same for Dr. Fauci.
TITLE=> Series of Opinions on Biden vs. Harris Debate. ARTICLE=> Since the democratic debate on June 27th, Kamala Harris (D–California) has gained significant popularity in the polls.

ARTICLE=> Officials in the U.S. and Europe have sharply criticized Belarus for grounding a Ryanair commercial flight to arrest Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old journalist who ran a messaging app used to coordinate protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The plane was escorted to Minsk, Belarus by a fighter jet after it crossed over Belarusian airspace on its way to Vilnius, Lithuania from Athens, Greece. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken demanded the journalist’s release on Sunday, condemning “the Lukashenka regime’s brazen and shocking act.” The same day, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary called Belarus’ actions “a case of state-sponsored hijacking.” The European Commission will reportedly meet to discuss the situation on Monday.  Coverage from across the spectrum was generally balanced, focusing on the widespread statements condemning Belarus’ actions.

Many media outlets are offering live coverage of the situation as more details emerge.
TITLE=> Biden to Cancel Keystone XL Pipeline Permit on First Day in Office. ARTICLE=> President-elect Joe Biden will revoke the Keystone XL Pipeline’s permit shortly after taking office on Wednesday, multiple reports say. The pipeline, which would transport crude oil from Canada to refineries in Texas and Louisiana, was reauthorized by President Donald Trump in 2017 after being rejected by President Barack Obama in 2015. Biden, however, plans to put the U.S. on track to reach "a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050." The pipeline’s developer, TC Energy, reportedly plans to save its $8 billion contract by promising to use renewable energy in pipeline operations, hire a union workforce, and eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions from operations by 2030. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to address anti-pipeline advocacy by environmentalists and some indigenous groups. As of Monday afternoon, only some right- and center-rated outlets had original coverage of TC Energy’s reported planned changes to the project. A few outlets from both ends of the spectrum discussed the Canadian government’s support of the pipeline.
TITLE=> Trump vs. Ginsburg. ARTICLE=> Donald Trump responded to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's negative comments by calling on her to step down.
TITLE=> In Some Areas, Coronavirus has Hit Minorities Harder. ARTICLE=> Reporting and analysis from many major news outlets has focused on how the COVID-19 coronavirus could be affecting minority groups at a disproportionate rate. Some evidence shows minorities dying at significantly higher rates in certain regions; data from other states, such as California, does not. Many of the datasets in question are limited or incomplete in some way. The issue has mainly garnered coverage from left- and center-rated outlets, with few right-rated outlets offering original reporting or research on the topic.
TITLE=> Democrats Introduce Bill To Raise Minimum Wage To $15 by 2025. ARTICLE=> Democrats in the House and Senate reintroduced legislation on Tuesday that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025. If passed, the Raise the Wage Act would eventually more than double the current $7.25 federal minimum wage and tie it to median wage growth beyond 2025. While the bill passed in the House in July 2020, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate without using budget reconciliation, a process which bypasses the filibuster in certain situations. Renewed efforts to raise the minimum wage have gained strength with the support of President Joe Biden, who called for a $15 minimum wage in his COVID-19 relief proposal and issued an executive order setting the stage for a $15 minimum wage for federal government workers. As of Tuesday afternoon, coverage was most prevalent in center-rated outlets and business-focused outlets. Coverage in some right- and left-rated outlets portrayed Congressional Budget Office projections on the $15 minimum wage differently, highlighting more negative or positive predictions, respectively.

TITLE=> White House Says Biden Will Not Create Presidential Commission to Probe Jan. 6 Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> The White House said Thursday that President Joe Biden does not have plans to create a presidential commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told Axios that "Congress was attacked on that day, and President Biden firmly agrees with Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi that Congress itself has a unique role and ability to carry out that investigation. Because of that, the President doesn’t plan to appoint his own commission." NBC News reported that Pelosi Wednesday reportedly held a call with members of the House Democratic Caucus to preview options for a commission into the origins of the Jan. 6 breach after the idea of an independent bipartisan commission was rejected by Republican leaders. Some of those options reportedly include holding a second Senate vote in an attempt to overcome the filibuster, or calling on the House Homeland Security Committee's chair and ranking members to take the lead.  The story was first reported by Axios, and received consistent coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. 
TITLE=> Trump Will Announce Supreme Court Nominee on Friday or Saturday. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said Monday that he plans to name a Supreme Court nominee either Friday or Saturday after the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is laid to rest. Trump plans to move ahead with the naming of his third U.S. Supreme Court nomination, even as two Republican Senators — Lisa Murkowoski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — have publicly objected to holding a vote on a nominee before the 2020 election. Democrats are meanwhile working to sway the two additional GOP senators needed to block a confirmation vote.

TITLE=> Trump Campaign Loses Election Lawsuits in Three States. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Donald Trump's campaign lost a string of cases in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan after his campaign filed lawsuits alleging election irregularities and improper ballot-counting procedures in five states where projected winner Joe Biden leads. The Trump campaign had a win on Thursday when a Pennsylvania judge granted their request to disqualify ballots for which voters needed to provide proof of identification and failed to do so by Nov. 9. This comes after Trump recently put personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in charge of election lawsuits. The lawsuits received wide coverage and analysis from left- and center-rated outlets, and less overall coverage from right-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Concerns About Mail-In Voting Rise as Elections Draw Near. ARTICLE=> As the November general elections draw near and COVID-19 coronavirus cases continue to rise around the nation, the debate around in-person voting and mail-in voting heats up. In-person voting can carry more health risks, while mail-in voting can raise election security concerns. At least 41 states will reportedly allow people to vote by mail this year. Right- and center-rated outlets tend to cover these voter fraud stories more diligently, including this week's voter fraud scandal in Philadelphia. Left-rated outlets, on the other hand, tended to emphasize the higher risk of catching the virus while voting in person, also pointing out that some politicians who oppose mail-in voting have voted by mail in the past.
TITLE=> Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram Back Up After Major Outage. ARTICLE=> Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram experienced a major worldwide outage on Monday. The company says the outage was due to an internal technical issue related to faulty configuration changes in the company's internal tools. The failure disrupted the digital lives of many politicians, small-business owners, aid workers and others. The outage also reportedly hampered Facebook's ability to fix the crash and employees' abilities to access company tools. The company is already under fire after a whistle-blower, Frances Haugen, shared internal documents claiming that Facebook knows of its negative impacts on public health but chooses to prioritize profit. 	The news was covered prominently across the spectrum with few partisan divides in coverage.
TITLE=> US Jobless Claims Rise to 744,000. ARTICLE=> Jobless claims rose to 744,000 in the week ending April 3, an increase of 16,000 from the previous week, as layoffs continue even as more individuals receive coronavirus vaccinations. Many states eased or eliminated restrictions on businesses, including restaurants and bars, in March. Some said Covid-19 infections have recently been rising, which could be a drag on workers seeking employment and hiring. Others noted the economic rebound came sooner than many economists expected at the beginning of the year, but labor demand will have to significantly increase before employment returns to pre-pandemic levels.
TITLE=> Trump Threatens Government Shutdown Over Border Wall. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said he would allow the federal government to shut down if Democrats do not fund his border wall and back immigration law changes, betting that maintaining a hard line will work in Republicans’ favor in November congressional elections.
TITLE=> Opposing Fact Checks on Trump's Disinfectant Remarks Fuel Misinformation. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's inquiry about possibly using disinfectant to treat the COVID-19 coronavirus at last Thursday's White House press briefing sparked a slew of online misinformation. Different fact-checkers reached different conclusions, displaying various forms of media bias in how they perceived and analyzed the remarks. AllSides concludes that many media outlets located throughout the political spectrum conducted poor and sometimes misleading "fact checks" that negatively affected the public's ability to accurately discern what the president said and meant. The president suggested looking into "something like" disinfectant injections as a possible COVID-19 treatment; he did not suggest people self-medicate by injecting disinfectant.
TITLE=> Controversy Surrounds Trump Church Visit, Dispersal of Protesters. ARTICLE=> Media coverage of President Donald Trump's Monday appearance at St John's Episcopal Church in Washington D.C. has differed greatly along partisan lines. Coverage from many left-rated outlets and some center-rated outlets focused more on the purportedly excessive use of tear gas, flash bang grenades and other crowd control measures to clear the protesters prior to the president's arrival. Conversely, some coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated more on the fact that rioters set fire to the church the night before, while painting the president's appearance as a well-intentioned attempt to promote civility and faith.
TITLE=> CDC Denies Report Listing Banned Words.

TITLE=> Global Supply Chain Leaders Warn Of 'System Collapse' Due To Pandemic Restrictions. ARTICLE=> A coalition of international business leaders representing shipping workers worldwide has warned that supply chains are at risk of a “global transport systems collapse” due to labor shortages caused by pandemic-related restrictions on trade. In a joint open letter sent to the heads of state attending the United Nations General Assembly, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and other industry groups called on world leaders to "remove restrictions hampering the free movement of transport workers, and guarantee and facilitate their free and safe movement." Failure to act would likely "exacerbate shortages of essential goods including electronics, food, fuel and medical supplies ahead of Christmas." They also advised WHO to establish a “globally harmonized, digital” vaccination certificate so that supply chain workers can cross international borders with ease. According to a study from Oracle, about 91% of Americans are now taking the status of the supply chain into consideration when making a purchase — a significant increase from 45% before 2020. The study also found that more than half of Americans "fear the supply-chain crisis will never end." Coverage was prominent across the spectrum. Some left-rated voices emphasized how "the unequal distribution of vaccines globally" contributed to the supply chain dilemma. Some right-rated voices noted that the rise in demand and diminishing supplies will result in inflation, criticizing corporate America for becoming overreliant on the global supply chain rather than producing products domestically.
TITLE=> Coronavirus Riles Criminal Justice System. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is having an especially extreme impact in close-quarters settings, including jails and prisons; the Bureau of Prisons announced earlier this week that of roughly 2,700 federal inmates tested for the coronavirus, 70% were shown to have COVID-19. The question of how to combat that reality is the center of debate over criminal justice reform, public safety and human rights. Left-rated outlets and voices have covered the issue more closely, with some urging a creative use of commutations, home confinement and other alternative detainment methods to protect prisoners and avoid amplified outbreaks. Some right-rated voices criticized movements to release prisoners, alleging that such decisions were made in pursuit of ideological goals rather than true public safety.

And last week, Trump said he would accept the Republican nomination in the convention’s original host city of Charlotte, North Carolina — which he spurned in June over its coronavirus-related public health restrictions.
TITLE=> Hundreds Arrested in Moscow Protests. ARTICLE=> Russian Police detained more than 1,000 protesters in Moscow on Saturday. Demonstrators called for fair elections after opposition candidates were excluded from running for city council. News outlets on the left tended to report 1,000-1,400 arrests, while many on the right reported "at least" 500-800. Center outlets saw a similar divide internally.
TITLE=> Border Security Heightened Awaiting Migrant Caravan. ARTICLE=> With already 2,100 National Guardsmen spread across the southern border, another 1,000 troops have been approved to be sent as well.

TITLE=> Judge Rules Clinicians Cannot Object to Abortions on Moral or Religious Grounds. ARTICLE=> A federal judge in New York rejected a rule Wednesday that would have permitted doctors and nurses to refuse performing an abortion on a moral or religious basis. The rule, proposed by the Trump administration and set to go into effect later this month, was opposed in several lawsuits, including one signed by 19 states, the District of Columbia and three local governments. While the majority of coverage presented both sides of the issue, left and center-rated outlets tended to focus coverage more on the lawsuits targeting the rule and the arguments against it; most right-rated outlets instead focused coverage on arguments in favor of the rule.
TITLE=> Trump to Speak at CPAC. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump has announced that he will speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday.

TITLE=> SCOTUS Dismisses Travel Ban Case. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court dismissed a major challenge to President Trump's travel ban on majority-Muslim countries Tuesday because it has been replaced by a new version, sending the controversy back to the starting block.
TITLE=> House Passes $25 Billion USPS Bill. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives approved a $25 billion emergency funding bill for the U.S. Postal Service on Saturday to aid mail-in voting during the upcoming presidential elections. The legislation will also block cuts and operational changes deployed by Trump’s postmaster general. This comes after Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced last week he would suspend recently instituted mail service changes until after the election in November, though DeJoy denied charges that the changes would hamper the vote-by-mail process. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed the bill as Democrats "rescuing" the USPS from Trump's "attacks." Some voices from the right criticized the bill as "just a political statement." Several voices from both the right and the left pointed to evidence that the USPS doesn't actually need a large financial bailout.
TITLE=> Washington Post Faces Backlash After Headline On ISIS Leader's Death. ARTICLE=> The Washington Post  is receiving backlash after calling ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an "austere religious scholar." Al-Baghdadi was initially labeled the "Islamic State's terrorist-in-chief" before the notice was changed soon after. The Post then corrected the current title, calling him an "extremist leader of the Islamic State." A Post editor said the notice "never should have read that way." Journalists from all sides of the spectrum mocked the death notice, especially on social media.
TITLE=> Biden Says Activists Confronting Sinema Was Inappropriate but 'Part of the Process'. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Monday that activists had behaved inappropriately when they confronted Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Sunday, but that such confrontations were not unusual. Activists from Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA) had confronted Sinema and followed her into an Arizona State University bathroom while criticizing her opposition to Democrats' budget reconciliation bill. Responding to reporters, Biden said, “I don’t think they’re appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody. The only people it doesn’t happen to is people who have Secret Service standing around them. It’s part of the process.” Sinema herself condemned the confrontation, calling it “unacceptable”  and “wholly inappropriate.”  Coverage was more common in center- and right-rated outlets, some of which framed Biden’s “it happens to everybody” line as a dismissal of the incident. Left-rated outlets were more likely to call the activists “youth organizers,” with other outlets labeling them “activists” or “organizers.”
TITLE=> New York Becomes First Major US City to Mandate COVID-19 Vaccination for Most Indoor Activities. ARTICLE=> New York City will require proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine for both workers and customers to enter restaurants, fitness centers and indoor entertainment venues, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday. “If you want to participate in our society fully, you’ve got to get vaccinated. So it’s time, and this is going to send that message clearly,” de Blasio said. De Blasio added that this would be a “first-in-the-nation” approach, coming as several businesses and government agencies are requiring workers to get vaccinated. The title of the plan, the “Key to NYC Pass,” does not refer to a specific document or “vaccine passport,” but rather to the overall program, which de Blasio said would use “the vaccination card or the NYC app or the Excelsior Pass” for proof of vaccination. The mandate goes into effect Aug. 16, and full enforcement begins Sept. 13. Coverage was more prominently displayed in left- and center-rated outlets, with coverage across the spectrum taking a backseat to coverage of the investigation into New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s reported sexual harassment. Coverage in right-rated outlets was more likely to discuss “vaccine passports,” with at least one article incorrectly saying that the “Key to NYC Pass” was itself a vaccine passport.
TITLE=> C-Span Suspends Editor for Lying About Twitter Hack. ARTICLE=> C-Span suspended its anchor Steve Scully, who was to moderate the now-canceled second presidential debate, for falsely claiming that his Twitter was hacked last week. Scully claimed that the hacking accounted for a tweet sent from Scully's account asking former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci for advice on how to respond to the President Donald Trump, who recently said he believed Scully is a "never-Trumper" who "worked for Biden at one point." Both C-Span and the Commission for Presidential Debates came to Scully's defense. On Thursday, Scully apologized for lying about the hack. The story was covered by outlets across the political spectrum, but covered with more prominence by right-rated media. Some voices from the right, including President Donald Trump, pointed to Scully's falsehood as evidence that the debate was rigged in Joe Biden's favor and highlighted Scully's history of claiming his Twitter account had been hacked.
TITLE=> Florida Bans Transgender Athletes From Competing in Female Sports. ARTICLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed into law a bill prohibiting transgender women from competing in female sports at public schools and colleges on Tuesday. The Fairness in Women's Sports Act requires transgender athletes to compete on the team of the biological sex displayed on their birth certificate. "We believe that is very important that the integrity of these competitions are preserved," DeSantis said. "We're gonna go based on biology, not based on ideology when we're doing sports." Selina Soule, a Connecticut high school track athlete who was bested by transgender athlete Terry Miller in 2019, spoke at the bill signing, saying the experience was “frustrating” and “demoralizing.” The Human Rights Campaign said Tuesday it plans to challenge the legislation in court.  Many on the right praised DeSantis for "protecting" women's sports. Many Democrats claim the bill is transphobic and discriminatory, and that signing the bill during Pride Month is "additionally cruel"; DeSantis said the timing was coincidental. Most outlets covered the details of the bill; some right-rated outlets covered the backlash DeSantis received from those on the left. 
TITLE=> Chicago Police Probe Findings. ARTICLE=> A sprawling federal investigation into the Chicago police found that officers engage “in a pattern or practice of use of excessive force,” part of larger, ingrained failures in how the department trains officers and reviews misconduct, Attorney General Loretta E.

TITLE=> Justice Alito Reflects on Current Events, Drawing Different Reactions. ARTICLE=> Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito spoke to the conservative Federalist Society on Thursday, discussing his views on the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, LGBTQ+ rights, free speech and other issues. Alito's speech was a focus of news media on all sides of the political spectrum. Coverage of the speech from right-rated sources generally focused on Alito's stated concerns about religious freedom, prolonged coronavirus lockdowns and other individual liberties, and didn't usually tie the speech to partisan politics. Conversely, many reports from left- and center-rated outlets concentrated on criticisms of his speech. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed Alito as having broken with Supreme Court precedent by purportedly abandoning impartiality in favor of cross-party opposition.
TITLE=> $1.9T Stimulus Bill Nears Passage. ARTICLE=> House Democrats plan to approve the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package on Wednesday, after which it would be sent to President Joe Biden's desk where he'll sign it into law. Progressives in the House have voiced frustration with recent changes and the exclusion of a $15 federal minimum wage proposition, but reportedly plan to vote for the relief package anyway. Many Republicans oppose the plan, claiming it contains a number of progressive priorities unrelated to pandemic relief. Correction at 10:57 a.m. ET on 3/9/21: This headline roundup initially linked to an old Business Insider article, and incorrectly reported that the House vote (which already happened) was scheduled for this Friday. We regret the error.

TITLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Criticizes Biden on COVID-19. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) said he will "stand in the way" of President Joe Biden and any COVID-19 rules that would restrict Floridians' freedoms or hurt local businesses. DeSantis argued that Biden is wrong to require Americans to follow coronavirus restrictions while allowing immigrants who may have COVID-19 to enter the United States. According to the New York Times (Lean Left bias), Florida is averaging over 17,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, the highest infection rate the state has experienced during the pandemic. The average number of daily COVID-19 related deaths in Florida is currently increasing, but remains well below its pandemic peak.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Fox News Stands Behind Tucker Carlson As Calls Mount For His Removal Over 'White Replacement' Comments. ARTICLE=> Fox News is standing behind host Tucker Carlson after the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called Friday for the media company to fire Carlson for saying on his show last week that immigration to the United States would “dilute the political power” of Americans. Carlson suggested that the Democratic Party "is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World." In a letter to Fox News, ADL called for Carlson's removal due to an “open-ended endorsement of white supremacist ideology." Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said in a response to ADL Monday that Carlson “decried and rejected replacement theory” when he said during the segment, “White replacement theory? No, no, this is a voting rights question.” The ADL replied Monday to Murdoch, saying that Carlson used white-supremacist language even if he claimed he didn’t. Tucker doubled down on his remarks on his show Monday, saying, "Demographic change is the key to the Democratic Party's political ambitions." Carlson's comments received pushback from many across the political spectrum. The story was widely covered by outlets from the left and center, and received less overall coverage from right-rated outlets. Many left voices, as well as center- and left-rated outlets criticized Carlson for his comments and Fox News for their support of him. Editors note: After we originally posted this headline roundup, Tucker Carlson published his response to the criticism. To provide a better breadth of perspectives, we updated our articles to include his response.

TITLE=> Asymptomatic Coronavirus Cases Come into Focus. ARTICLE=> As the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak intensifies, attention has turned to asymptomatic cases, in which infected persons do not display signs of infection.

TITLE=> What To Expect From This Year's 'Lame Duck' Congress. ARTICLE=> Congress will reconvene this month to tackle major issues following an election that unseated some current members. Both major parties have discussed passing a COVID-19 coronavirus relief package before the end of the year, despite past statements that relief would come in 2021. Congress also needs to fund the government ahead of the December 11 deadline to avoid another shutdown. Furthermore, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that Republicans would "clean the plate" on federal judge confirmations. The Senate and House are scheduled to return on November 9 and 16, respectively. Coverage came mostly from center- and left-rated outlets and mainly focused on COVID-19 relief negotiations. Coverage in right-rated outlets focused more on Nancy Pelosi and Democrats' election performance.
TITLE=> Trump Considering Commutation For Blagojevich. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has signaled that he is considering commuting the prison sentence of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich (D). Blagojevich was convicted of corruption in connection with selling former President Barack Obama's old Illinois Senate seat after Obama became president. Blagojevich was impeached in 2009 and went to jail in 2012, and is currently scheduled to be released in 2026. Current Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D), was investigated by the FBI in relation to the Blagojevich scandal, but was never indicted. There is no significant difference between media coverage, as Blagojevich has not been pardoned or had his sentence commuted.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Appears Divided in Major Abortion Case. ARTICLE=> Court watchers and the media alike have observed a split between Supreme Court justices in the court's first abortion-related case in the Trump appointee era. While the youngest member of the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, asked questions during a Wednesday hearing, his Trump-appointed counterpart Neil Gorsuch reportedly remained silent. The case, which apparently may be decided by Chief Justice John Roberts' vote, involves abortion regulations in Louisiana requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals. It was estimated in a prior ruling that only three abortion clinics in Louisiana would remain open had the law stayed in effect.
TITLE=> Weekly Jobless Claims Rise to 419,000. ARTICLE=> Jobless claims rose to 419,000 last week, higher than the 350,000 Dow Jones estimate for initial filings.

TITLE=> Trump Signs Executive Order Aimed at Improving Child Welfare System. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday directed at improving the child welfare system and decreasing the amount of time kids spend in foster care before they are permanently placed with families. The order reportedly aims to give care providers access to better funding, tools for education, and ways of dealing with trauma. Only three sources rated as either left or center— the ACLU, the Hill and the Associated Press — covered the order, while it received more frequent coverage from right-rated outlets. The ACLU took issue with the order's focus on increased involvement of "faith-based" agencies, saying that state governments should know "religion is not a license to discriminate." Coverage from right-rated sources framed the order more as a well-intentioned effort from the Trump administration.
TITLE=> A Look at Trump's Tax Reform Plan. ARTICLE=> A look at President Trump's tax reform plan - who are the winners and losers? Are there ideas in the tax plan that Democrats can support?

TITLE=> Education Department To Investigate Five States That Banned Mask Mandates In Schools. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) announced an investigation Monday into whether prohibitions of indoor mask mandates constitute discrimination against students with health conditions and disabilities. The DOE's Office for Civil Rights addressed their concerns in letters sent to the education chiefs in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, where mask mandates in schools have been banned. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona accused the governors of these states of “putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve.” The DOE will determine if each state in question has complied with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which protects qualified students from discrimination based on their disability. The department also disclosed that regional civil rights offices will be collecting data from the aforementioned states during the coming weeks. Left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how banning mask mandates could prevent millions of students with disabilities to attend in-person classes safely. Most outlets mentioned how the investigation will most likely receive backlash from conservatives who believe mask mandates have gone too far and could have negative psychological effects on children.
TITLE=> Trump and Media Response to Al Franken. ARTICLE=> Senator Al Franken has faced much controversy this week after Leeann Tweeden accused him of sexual harrassment on a USO tour in 2006.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden Nominates Pete Buttigieg For Transportation Secretary. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, President-elect Joe Biden tapped South Bend, Indianan Mayor Pete Buttigieg as his pick for Transportation Secretary. In the announcement, Biden praised Buttigieg for being the “first openly gay major presidential candidate in American history.” Upon the announcement, several media outlets hailed Buttigieg for being the "first openly gay Cabinet member"; though some voices from the right pointed out that the first openly gay Cabinet member was Richard Grenell, who was appointed as the acting director of national intelligence by President Donald Trump in February. Others made the distinction Buttigieg would make the first openly gay member of a presidential Cabinet to be confirmed by the Senate. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to frame Buttigieg's nomination as "historic" and a "win for the LGBTQ+ community." Some coverage from right-rated outlets tended to point out that Buttigieg will not be the first openly gay Cabinet member. Other voices from the left and right highlighted a now-deleted tweet in which the Biden campaign purportedly poked fun at Buttigieg's lack of experience.
TITLE=> Biden and CDC Director Warn of Possible Virus Rebound.

TITLE=> Six Injured in Clash Between Free Speech Rally and Counter-Protesters. ARTICLE=> Six people were injured during clashes between a "Free Speech Rally Against Twitter and Big Tech" and counter-protesters in San Francisco on Saturday. The rally, organized by Team Save America and held at U.N. Plaza near Twitter's headquarters, was protesting Twitter's apparent censorship of the New York Post's article about Hunter Biden's emails allegedly detailing corrupt behavior by his father, Joe Biden. Before the rally, interactions between rally-goers and counter-protesters, some clad in black and holding signs that bore anti-fascist messages, reportedly grew violent. Before the event, main organizer Philip Anderson said he was punched, and tweeted pictures apparently showing his front teeth knocked out. The story was widely covered by right-rated outlets, who tended to frame the clashes as attacks against free speech and censorship against conservative voices. The story received less coverage overall from left- and center-rated outlets, though it was covered by some including the Associated Press, San Francisco Chronicle, and the Washington Post.
TITLE=> Andrew Cuomo Accuser Brittany Commisso Comes Forward. ARTICLE=> Brittany Commisso, a former executive assistant to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), broke her anonymity this week and came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the governor.

Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday after previously refusing calls to step down; the New York State Assembly was planning to hold impeachment hearings by the end of August. 	Commisso's comments made headlines across the spectrum. Coverage on all sides speculated about what criminal charges Cuomo may face, as well as the likelihood of him being impeached. Updated 8/10/21 at 12:40pm ET to include mention of Cuomo's resignation.
TITLE=> Trump Makes Controversial Statements in Fox News Interview; Media Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Fox News aired an interview with President Donald Trump in which Trump made multiple controversial statements. These statements included suggesting Joe Biden was being “controlled” by people “in the dark shadows”; comparing police who use deadly force to golfers who “choke”; claiming that a plane “loaded with thugs” was allegedly going to the Republican National Convention “to do big damage”; and advising his supporters to “leave it to law enforcement” to “confront” protesters instead of taking matters into their own hands. Coverage in right-rated outlets generally framed the interview as less controversial, while coverage in left- and center-rated outlets tended to cover it as being more controversial. Some coverage in left-rated outlets painted Trump’s comments as conspiracy theories, and highlighted interviewer Laura Ingraham's purported efforts to help him avoid questionable answers.
TITLE=> How Coronavirus Will Alter 2020 Election for Top Candidates. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed the 2020 presidential election. Primary votes have been cancelled in some states, campaign efforts have moved completely online, and candidates are moving to try and use the pandemic-induced chaos to their advantage.Current polls generally indicate a slight lead for former Vice President Joe Biden over current President Donald Trump, a fact that's been central to recent election coverage. Many reports detailed how the dire economic state — and the prospects of recovery — might work into candidates' campaign plans. Some left-rated voices concentrated on Trump's purported attempts to wield the coronavirus crisis against Biden, while some right-rated outlets focused more on Biden's campaign and perceived shortcomings. Meanwhile, libertarian-leaning voices have examined Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI), who's running as the Libertarian party's candidate, and whether or not he aligns with the party's core values.
TITLE=> Nation Prepares for Possible Unrest Ahead of Biden Inauguration.

Military leaders called Thursday and Friday for state leaders across the country to send extra troops; some responded to the call, while others declined, securing their own cities in anticipation of unrest after the Capitol building was breached on Jan. 6. States including Wisconsin and Oregon stationed security in their cities. The Associated Press reported Thursday that the FBI were tracking "online chatter" regarding armed protests in the upcoming week. Media outlets across the political spectrum covered the news. Some coverage reported that despite the extra security, few protesters showed up at the U.S. Capitol over the weekend.
TITLE=> What to Watch for: 2020 Senate Races. ARTICLE=> People across the country will vote in 35 U.S. Senate elections Tuesday, with some being more contested than others. Republicans currently enjoy a 53-47 majority in the Senate, but Democrats now have a chance to establish their own majority.

The CDC defined close contact as 15 minutes spent within six feet of an infected person.

The story was widely covered by outlets across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> President Trump Unveils Plan to Lower Prescription Drug Prices.

TITLE=> McCain to Vote No on Healthcare Bill. ARTICLE=> Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal.

TITLE=> AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Up to 90% Effective, Cheaper Than Alternatives. ARTICLE=> Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca announced Monday that its COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine, developed in collaboration with Oxford University, could be as much as 90% effective. The vaccine does not require storage at below-freezing temperatures, allowing for easier distribution. This and other factors contribute to a cost of $2.50 per dose, much cheaper than the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which reportedly cost over $20 per dose. Late-stage trials showed that the vaccine was 70% effective on average, 62% effective when given as two full doses, and 90% effective when given as a half-dose followed by a full dose one month later. AstraZeneca said it could have 200 million doses by the end of 2020 and 700 million doses by the end of the first quarter of 2021; one Oxford scientist called it “a vaccine for the world.” Coverage was mostly balanced across bias ratings.

ARTICLE=> Former White House counsel Donald McGahn was ordered to testify before impeachment investigators in a ruling from a federal judge handed down Monday, defying President Donald Trump's declaration that top presidential advisers have "absolute immunity" from testifying in the impeachment inquiry. The judge ruled that if McGahn is to assert executive privilege in testifying, he must do so in-person and on a question-by-question basis; he was first subpoenaed by House investigators in April. Many reports, regardless of political leaning, say the case could set a precedent for executive privilege disputes between the White House and Congress. Some left-leaning reports painted the news as a "victory" for Democrats, while some right-leaning voices concentrated on the Justice Department's reported intention to appeal the decision.
TITLE=> Officer Who Shot Daunte Wright To Be Charged With 2nd Degree Manslaughter. ARTICLE=> Washington County Attorney Pete Orput announced Wednesday that Kim Potter, the police officer who shot Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota on Sunday, will be charged with second-degree manslaughter.

TITLE=> Senate Authorizes Subpoenas of Facebook, Google and Twitter CEOs. ARTICLE=> The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously on Thursday to authorize subpoenas to compel testimony from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs will likely face questions about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability over what their users post, as well as questions about privacy and “media domination.” This comes after the Trump administration pressured Senate Republicans to increase scrutiny of social media companies over allegations of anti-conservative bias. Senate Democrats voiced concerns that Republicans are “playing the refs” in an attempt to facilitate misinformation online. Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to cast doubt on claims of anti-conservative bias online, ranging from calling the phenomenon “non-existent” to saying there is “limited academic data” to support the claim. Coverage in center- and right-rated outlets reported Republicans’ claims without addressing their accuracy.
TITLE=> AOC's Chief of Staff and Top Spokesman Leave Her Office. ARTICLE=> Rep.

Chakrabarti is leaving to work with New Consensus on the Green New Deal. Trent is leaving to work on Ocasio-Cortez's 2020 reelection campaign as communications director. Media outlets on the right and in the center focused on Chakrabarti's involvement in controversies including his recent criticism of moderate Democrats. Media outlets on the left pointed out the exit had been planned since before AOC's feud with moderate Democrats earlier this month, which lead to Trump's controversial tweets about leftist House Democrats.

TITLE=> Attorney General Nominee Merrick Garland Gets Senate Confirmation Hearing. ARTICLE=> Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden's nominee for attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, where he vowed to guard the Justice Department from political influence and prioritize an investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. Garland, a federal appeals court judge, managed the investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and supervised the prosecution of the "Unabomber" Theodore Kaczynski. If appointed, Garland would inherit several cases from the previous administration, including a probe into Hunter Biden's taxes and John Durham's investigation of the origins of the probe into former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. During questioning, Garland said he would allow Durham's investigation to continue, and promised to remain impartial in the investigation into Hunter Biden. Addressing a question from Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, Garland also said that Antifa’s attacks on a Portland courthouse last year may not have been “domestic terrorism,” because they took place at night when the court was not “in operation,” unlike the Capitol breach. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on Garland's vow of impartiality, as well as his pledge to focus on the Capitol breach. Some right-rated outlets highlighted Garland's distinction between the Capitol breach and Portland riots.

TITLE=> NYC City Council Votes to Shift $1 Billion Away From Police Force. ARTICLE=> New York City Council voted Wednesday in favor of a budget that moves $1 billion away from the city's police force. The overhaul is aimed at reducing overtime spending and improving the city's mental health and homelessness outreach; it also led to the cancellation of a 1,200-person police recruiting class scheduled for August. Coverage on all sides framed the changes as inadequate, but for differing reasons. Coverage from some left- and center-rated sources painted the budget as not doing enough to curtail the NYPD's financial power; some advocates called instead for a full hiring freeze. Coverage from some right-rated outlets focused on criticisms of the budget from law enforcement personnel, who argue the cuts are merely an accounting gimmick and decry City Council for supposedly bowing to "mob rule".
TITLE=> Rep. Chris Collins Resigns Ahead of Guilty Plea. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) has submitted his letter of resignation to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of a pretrial court date where he is expected to plead guilty to insider trading. Collins and his son were arrested in August 2018 and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, making false statements, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud. While left-leaning reporting drew connections between President Trump and Rep. Collins, right-leaning outlets tended to not mention any relationship between the two.

TITLE=> Biden Defends Afghanistan Withdrawal After Taliban Takeover. ARTICLE=> In his first public remarks since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, President Joe Biden said he stood “squarely behind” his decision to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan on Monday. “American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,” Biden said, adding, “I will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference.” Biden admited that the Taliban’s advance “did unfold more quickly” than his administration had anticipated and said he accepted his “share of the responsibility for where we are today,” saying, “the buck stops with me.” On the current situation, Biden pledged that the U.S. military would continue to support the evacuation from Kabul airport of American citizens, civilian personnel, and Afghans who are eligible for special immigrant visas under Operation Allies Refuge. Biden did not take questions from reporters after his speech.  Some homepage headlines varied sharply along partisan lines, most notably in CNN and Fox News, often differing from the actual headlines and content of articles. Some right-rated outlets framed their coverage around Biden purportedly shifting blame for the Taliban’s victory; some left-rated outlets framed their coverage around Biden’s “I stand squarely behind my decision” quote.
TITLE=> Gates Pleads Guilty. ARTICLE=> Richard Gates, former Trump campaign adviser and longtime junior business partner of Paul Manafort pleaded guilty Friday afternoon as part of a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Russian interference in the election.

ARTICLE=> Lawmakers in Iraq's parliament voted for a resolution on Sunday that would end U.S. military presence in the country by canceling a 2011 security agreement between Washington and Baghdad that stationed some 5,000 troops there to help in the fight against ISIS. The resolution, which still must be signed by the prime minister, comes just two days after a U.S. drone strike killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and was backed by most Shiite members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats. Media outlets on both sides of the aisle highlighted the rising regional tensions surrounding the vote, triggered by Soleimani's death.

TITLE=> U.S. Will No Longer Grant Visas to Diplomats' Same-Sex Partners Unless They're Married. ARTICLE=> The State Department will no longer grant visas to same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats, instead requiring that they be legally married. Supporters say the new directive holds homosexual and heterosexual couples to the same standard, while detractors point out that same-sex marriage is still illegal in 90 percent of the countries in the United Nations, some of which still penalize homosexual activity with the death penalty.
TITLE=> Links Between Cannabis, Illness Persist Despite Legalization Pushes.

TITLE=> Biden Defends Comments About Working With Segregationists. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden defended his comments on working with segregationists Wednesday night. The presidential candidate had received criticism for saying things were civil even when he had to work with segregationists during his time in Congress. "At least there was some civility," Biden said of working with segregationist senators James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia. "We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.” Many fellow Democratic presidential candidates criticized Biden, with Cory Booker (D-NJ) saying Biden should apologize for "using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to make our country better." Biden refused, defending his record on civil rights and saying, "There's not a racist bone in my body." In addition, MSNBC host Kasie Hunt wrongly stated that the two segregationist senators were Republican; they were Democrats. She later corrected herself on social media.
TITLE=> Trump Breaks Silence on Abortion Law. ARTICLE=> President Trump has given more details to his "strongly pro-life" views amid the controversy over new laws that have been passed in states.

TITLE=> Kyle Rittenhouse Charged With First-Degree Murder; Media Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, Kenosha County charged 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse with first-degree homicide and a host of other charges after Rittenhouse allegedly killed two and wounded one with a rifle during protests over Sunday’s police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse was arrested on Wednesday; Antioch police said Rittenhouse was charged as an adult. He is currently being held without bail at the Lake County juvenile detention facility; a court hearing Friday will determine whether to extradite him to Wisconsin. Video clips from Tuesday have begun surfacing, which tell pieces of the story. Clips appear to show Rittenhouse among the fray with a rifle as shots are fired; from a different angle, videos show Rittenhouse being chased by people throwing heavy objects and attempting to kick him in the face. Clips from earlier in the day on Tuesday have surfaced showing Rittenhouse with a self-described "local militia" who volunteered to assist police during the protests. Hours before the shooting occurred, Rittenhouse told a Daily Caller reporter that his job was “to protect this business...and to help people. If there's somebody hurt, I'm running into harm's way, that's why I have my rifle.”  Some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted the fact that Rittenhouse was being chased -- a fact many mainstream media outlets omitted. Several Fox News commentators framed the local militia as "vigilante justice" whose actions "filled a need" to "maintain order"; though other voices from the right disagreed. Some voices from the left called Fox News' framing of Rittenhouse "dangerous." Some left-rated outlets also framed the Rittenhouse story as an argument for gun control, highlighting the fact that he was breaking the law while openly carrying a gun as a minor.
TITLE=> Duckworth, Hirono Back Off Vow to Withhold Support of Biden Nominees. ARTICLE=> Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) have backed off their vow to oppose President Joe Biden's nominations to fill administration posts until the White House better promoted diversity. The pivot came on Tuesday, after the White House said it would add an Asian American Pacific Islander liaison to its staff. The threats to withhold support could have complicated matters for Biden as he seeks confirmation of high-level administration and judicial appointments from an evenly divided Senate.
TITLE=> Congressional Budget Office Says National Debt Headed Toward Historic Levels.

TITLE=> Perspectives: At Least 100 Americans Still Stuck in Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> The last U.S. troops have left Afghanistan, but at least 100 Americans who want to leave were left behind. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that 100-200 Americans are stuck in Afghanistan. The State Department is reportedly working with Qatar and Turkey to arrange charter flights out of the airport in Kabul; Blinken said Monday that he doesn't expect that process "to be easy or rapid." An ABC News/Ipsos poll released this week suggests that over 85% of Republicans, Democrats and independents believe U.S. troops shouldn't leave Afghanistan until all Americans are out. President Joe Biden told ABC on Aug. 18 that "if there's American citizens left, we're gonna stay to get them all out." National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday the U.S. had "the capacity to have 300 Americans" on the final flights out of Kabul, but Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie said Monday that no American citizens made it to those planes. 	The Americans left behind and Afghans who worked with the U.S. military were highlighted across the spectrum; some left-rated voices also highlighted "possibly thousands" of green card holders also stuck in Afghanistan. Many voices, especially right-rated voices, have strongly criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Americans still there, with some accusing leaders of giving leverage to terrorists. Many across the spectrum also highlighted the billions of dollars worth of U.S. military equipment abandoned and left to the Taliban.
TITLE=> Social Media Platforms Censor Doctors Purportedly Spreading Coronavirus Misinformation. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Breitbart News posted a video of a press conference in D.C. held by America’s Frontline Doctors and sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots. In it, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and front-line doctors shared their perspectives on coronavirus and public health. Some claims the speakers made are unconfirmed and believed by some to be false, including a Texas doctor's claim that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for the virus. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter removed footage of the press conference from their social media platforms for allegedly spreading misinformation. Clips from the conference were tweeted by President Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., leading Twitter to delete the tweets and to limit Trump Jr.'s account. Coverage of this story from left- and center-rated outlets focused on the claim that the information being shared was dubious. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to emphasize the purportedly unjust censorship of the video and tweets.
TITLE=> Pennsylvania Court Rules Gerrymandered Maps Unconstitutional. ARTICLE=> The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state's congressional district map was unfairly gerrymandered to benefit the GOP and that it must be redrawn before the 2018 midterm elections.
TITLE=> NYT's Controversial Coverage of Sexual Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden. ARTICLE=> The New York Times' investigation of Tara Reade's sexual assault allegation against 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been criticized by some, especially many on the right, for purportedly being biased in Biden's favor. In their investigation published Easter Sunday, the Times "found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.” Originally, that sentence continued after "Mr. Biden" by saying: "...beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.” The Times later removed that section without an explanation in the story. Executive editor Dean Baquet said in an interview published Monday that the change was made because "the [Biden] campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct, and that’s not what the sentence was intended to say."

TITLE=> Russia Announces World’s First COVID-19 Vaccine. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had granted regulatory approval for the world’s first coronavirus vaccine, developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute. Putin claimed that the vaccine, named “Sputnik V,” was safe and effective, and that it had already been given to his daughter. The vaccine has garnered scientific skepticism since it was hinted at last week. Sputnik V has yet to undergo “Phase 3” trials, a standard of vaccine development in which a vaccine is tested on thousands of people over several months. Outlets on all sides covered Russia’s vaccine. Some sources focused on scientific skepticism more than others, with many using the generalized “scientists” and others focusing on government officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.
TITLE=> Jobless Claims Rise to 885,000. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans filing for first-time jobless benefits last week rose to 885,000 from 862,000 a week earlier. Economists expect the job market to cool off until COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines are widely distributed.

TITLE=> Cuomo Aides Altered Reports to Hide Nursing Home Death Toll. ARTICLE=> Aides to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pushed health officials to hide the true COVID-19 death toll in state nursing homes, according to multiple reports published Thursday. The state's final report only included nursing-home residents who died inside those facilities, and didn't include infected residents who later died after being transferred to hospitals; reports say the actual nursing home death toll was roughly 50% higher than the administration said publicly. Last month, the governor accepted some blame for the lack of transparency about nursing home deaths, but also defended his administration's conduct. The news marks a progression in a series of controversies for Cuomo, who also stands accused of sexually harassing three women. The news was covered across the spectrum, but highlighted more prominently by right-rated outlets, many of which featured it as a top story on their website Friday. Some left-rated outlets, including the New York Times (Lean Left bias) featured the news atop their main news page; others, including CNN (Left) and NBC News (Lean Left), didn't feature the story on their homepage as of Friday morning.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Marijuana Legalization is On the Ballot In These Five States. ARTICLE=> This election year, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota are voting on the legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes. In Mississippi and South Dakota (on a separate ballot measure), voters can also cast their vote to legalize medical marijuana. Currently, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, though eleven states have also have legalized the possession and recreational use of marijuana by anyone over the age of 21. Several voices from the left and center point to the ballot measures as a reflection of a cultural shift in perspective when it comes to marijuana legalization, citing a 2019 Gallup poll which found that approximately two-thirds of Americans support legalization, and a Quinnipac University poll that showed 58 percent of participants supported legalization. Some left- and center-rated outlets framed the ballot measures as likely to pass, citing the polls as well as "past precedent." Some coverage from the right framed marijuana ballot measures as a Democratic Party effort "to swing the race."

TITLE=> Texas Doctor Sued After Providing Abortion in Defiance of New Law. ARTICLE=> In an opinion piece published by the Washington Post (Lean Left bias) on Saturday, a Texas doctor said he recently performed an abortion in violation of the state's new controversial abortion law. Dr. Alan Braid wrote in the column that he “had a duty of care to this patient.” The law prohibits abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. Two lawsuits had been filed against Braid as of Tuesday; neither lawsuit is explicitly pro-life, and lawyers have described them as tests of the law's constitutionality. The law allows anyone to sue a doctor or anyone else who aids in the abortion process for damages of up to $10,000. Left-rated outlets were more likely to frame Braid's actions as bold and highlight other individuals who are attempting to invalidate the abortion law. Right-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize how Braid "deliberately violated" the law and include quotes from people who opposed the move.
TITLE=> Tax Bill Vote Looms in House. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives is set to vote on the tax bill today. GOP House members are confident they have 218 votes to pass the bill.

TITLE=> Protesters Set Up 'Autonomous Zone' in Seattle. ARTICLE=> Protesters in Seattle have assumed control over a six-block stretch of the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, after police were forced to abandon their nearby precinct on Monday. The story is dominating headlines throughout the right-rated media spectrum, while left- and center-rated outlets are covering it far less prominently. Many right-rated voices have highlighted that fact, accusing some outlets of media bias in an supposed effort to downplay the purported anarchy. Some right-rated voices also framed the situation as violent mayhem, and promoted police-driven reports of protesters extorting money from local businesses. Coverage from left-rated outlets focused more on President Trump's branding of the protesters as "domestic terrorists," and his wars of words with Washington state's Democratic politicians. Some left-rated outlets also focused more on protester-driven reporting that overall violence has in fact subsided.
TITLE=> Top DoD Official to Step Down, Says He Was Asked to Resign. ARTICLE=> Undersecretary of defense John Rood, the Pentagon's top-ranking policy official, will reportedly resign effective February 28. Some right-rated outlets framed the resignation as the result of a mutual disagreement between the Pentagon and the White House, while many left- and center-rated outlets painted the move as an ousting at the hands of President Donald Trump. Rood's letter says Defense Secretary Mark Esper notified him of Trump's apparent intention to have him resign. The Pentagon confirmed the move in a statement Wednesday after details of Rood's resignation letter were made public; Rood was reportedly key in approving a controversial foreign aid package to Ukraine last year that eventually became the focus of Trump's impeachment.
TITLE=> Testifying Before Congress, Blinken Faces Bipartisan Criticism For Afghanistan Withdrawal. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced a second day of tough congressional questioning from lawmakers Tuesday about the Biden administration’s divisive withdrawal from Afghanistan. Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Jersey Democrat and committee chair Bob Menendez called the administration's withdrawal strategy "clearly and fatally flawed." He warned that he will "use of committee subpoena power to compel" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other Biden officials who dismiss the opportunity to appear before the committee. Menendez also told Blinken that the multiple administrations who "lied" about the stability of the Afghan government must face "accountability," requesting a full explanation that outlines their decision-making process. Idaho Republican Senator James Risch blamed the Biden administration of “ineptitude” that has tainted the country's international credibility, while Sen. Rand Paul called leaving the Bagram Airfield without notifying the base’s new Afghan commander "one of the worst military decisions in our history." Blinken has continually defended the Biden administration's withdrawal strategy, shifting the blame onto the Trump administration. He argued that the world still holds a "significant leverage" against the Taliban thanks to an international "collective strategy" with NATO, the E.U. and the U.N. Coverage was consistent across the spectrum, with some outlets noting that Blinken is facing "bipartisan criticism." Some right-rated outlets accentuated how Blinken was unsure if the man targeted by a U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan was an aid worker or an ISIS-K operative. Left-rated outlets dismissed the "Democratic conspiracy" that suggests Biden is being "censored" after he was cut off mid-sentence during a press conference Monday.
TITLE=> President Trump and Kim Jong Un Land in Singapore for Historic Summit. ARTICLE=> President Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un landed in Singapore on Monday for a historic summit where Trump will push for North Korea's denuclearization.

Supporters have said that he is ready for the diplomatic negotiations.
TITLE=> Hillary Clinton Wins California. ARTICLE=> Hillary makes history as the first woman to lead a major party ticket.
TITLE=> Trump Vetoes Defense Spending Bill. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump vetoed The National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday after it passed through Congress with wide bipartisan support. In a letter to Congress, Trump said he vetoed the $740 billion annual defense spending bill because the bill "includes language that would require the renaming of certain military installations," referring to a measure requiring the renaming of military bases named for Confederate generals. Trump also said it will "restrict the President's ability to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea," and criticized lawmakers’ refusal to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from being held liable for content on their platforms. In anticipation of the veto, the House will hold a veto override vote on Dec. 28; if the veto is successful, the Senate will hold a vote the next day. Coverage from the left tended to highlight Republican opposition to the president's veto. Coverage from center- and right-rated outlets tended to highlight Trump's remarks that the bill is a "gift to Russia and China."
TITLE=> Trump Issues Veto Over Emergency Declaration for Border Wall. ARTICLE=> On Friday President Donald Trump vetoed the congressional lawmakers rejection resolution to his declaration of a national emergency over the US border with Mexico.

Brooks was shot by police last Friday after failing a sobriety test. Brooks wrested away an officer's taser and ran with it, then was fatally shot by police after he pointed the stun gun at them. Two officers were involved in the 27-year-old's death; the officer who discharged his weapon was fired and the other was placed on administrative duty. Media outlets from across the spectrum reported on the news similarly. Some right-rated opinion authors offered defense for the officer's actions.
TITLE=> Perspectives: 6 Asian American Women Killed in Atlanta Attacks. ARTICLE=> When six women of Asian descent were shot and killed in Atlanta Tuesday, a number of news outlets focused on hate crimes and attacks on Asian American communities. The alleged shooter said racism toward Asians wasn't the motive, and police have noted that the shootings "may not be” racially motivated. White supremacy, hate and racism were issues covered by the right, left and center. Left- and center-rated outlets more often placed the shootings in the context of the recent rise in the number of hate crimes against Asian Americans. The White House implied that the Trump administration's rhetoric on the coronavirus pandemic elevated violent threats against Asian Americans.
TITLE=> CDC Considers Recommending all Americans Wear Face Masks in Public. ARTICLE=> The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could soon recommend that all Americans wear face masks in public to slow the coronavirus spread.

TITLE=> State-by-State Virus Management Under Watch as Reopenings Continue. ARTICLE=> States are being watched closely while slowly reopening businesses and returning to a state of normalcy as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic seemingly comes under more control. Many reports from all sides of the political spectrum focused on recent spikes in the number of coronavirus cases in some regions; some coverage from right-rated outlets framed those spikes in the context of recent protests, arguing that many activists have broken social distancing guidelines while publicly demonstrating. Some right-rated voices also concentrated on how states are purportedly allowing protests in spite of guidelines while continuing to restrict religious services.
TITLE=> Arizona and Wisconsin Certify Biden Victories, Trump Campaign Files Lawsuit. ARTICLE=> Arizona and Wisconsin certified Joe Biden’s presidential election victories on Monday. Officials from both parties in each state said their elections were "conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness." The Wisconsin certification follows a partial recount, requested and paid for by President Donald Trump's campaign, which slightly increased Biden’s 20,600-vote lead. On Tuesday, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin’s results, alleging that roughly 220,000 ballots from mostly Democratic counties violated state law. Coverage in some left-rated outlets called Trump’s fraud claims “conspiracies” and mentioned that the Trump campaign’s lawsuit targeted counties with a majority of Wisconsin’s black residents. Some coverage in right-rated outlets didn't counter Trump's claims, and mentioned the narrowness of Biden’s victories in each state.
TITLE=> At Least 15.1 Million COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Wasted Since March. ARTICLE=> At least 15.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been thrown away in the United States since March 1, according to government data received by NBC News through a public records request. According to the CDC, the national pharmacy chains that have self-reported the highest amount of wasted doses are Walgreens (2.6 million), CVS (2.3 million), Walmart (1.6 million) and Rite Aid (1.1 million). The number of reported discarded COVID-19 vaccine doses might be an undercount as the data does not include some states and federal agencies. However, as of Wednesday, approximately 443.7 million doses have been distributed in the U.S. — meaning that less than 3.5% of total doses have been wasted.  The report was predominantly covered by left-rated and center-rated outlets. Left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight the wasted doses as "an equity issue" as many countries around the globe are still awaiting more vaccines.
TITLE=> Kavanaugh on Labor. ARTICLE=> Reactions are mixed on how Brett Kavanaugh will impact organized labor if confirmed to the Supreme Court, with detractors saying he will damage workers' rights and supporters arguing that such claims are unjustified and hypocritical.
TITLE=> 3 Killed And 15 Injured In Shooting At California Garlic Festival.

TITLE=> Trump Condemns Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump released a two-minute, 41-second video on Twitter Thursday condemning the "heinous attack" on the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. Wednesday. He said those who breached the Capitol building Wednesday, many of whom were his supporters, had "defiled the seat of American democracy" and "do not represent our country." He acknowledged that a "new administration will be inaugurated January 20th" and said he's focused "on a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power." Trump called for Americans to "revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family"; he also continued calls for election reforms "to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections." Dozens were arrested, more than 50 police officers were hurt and five people died as a result of Wednesday's chaos. Trump's statements made headlines across the spectrum. Many reports, particularly from left-rated outlets but also from center and right-rated sources, often framed the remarks as past due and focused on Republican lawmakers who criticized his response to Wednesday's events.
TITLE=> Politics and the Emmys. ARTICLE=> The annual Emmy Awards were held last night with Stephen Colbert hosting the prime-time television awards ceremony. Many people were surprised by the appearance of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer who made a joke about the size of the Emmys crowd. There has been a lot of response in the media today to this appearance as well as the many mentions of President Donald Trump during the show. Many writers on the left have argued that Spicer's appearance was not appropriate, while some on the right have found fault with the politicization of the show.
TITLE=> CDC Recommends Against Traveling for Thanksgiving. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending against traveling for Thanksgiving this year, with updated official guidance saying that "Postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others this year." While the new guidance is not mandatory, the CDC's Dr. Henry Walke called it "a strong recommendation." However, some states and local governments are implementing mandatory restrictions. CDC officials said the new guidance was the result of a recent spike in COVID-19 coronavirus cases, which has seen over a million new cases per week and record hospitalizations. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Coverage in some left-rated outlets mentioned some public health officials' disagreements with President Donald Trump. Coverage in some right-rated outlets simplified the CDC's guidance as "the best plan for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday is no plan."
TITLE=> Perspectives: Nevada Democratic Caucus Results. ARTICLE=> Nevada's Democratic caucus concluded on Saturday with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the lead, former Vice President Joe Biden in second, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg in third. Though some votes are still being counted and the final margin remains unclear, many outlets have already declared Sanders the victor, having won 46% of the vote with 60% of precincts reporting (Biden is at 19%, while Buttigieg is at 15%). As outlets on both the left and right point out, the results add to Sanders' win in New Hampshire and popular vote victory in Iowa, and likely cement his status as the Democratic front-runner. News and analysis following the caucus questioned what that means both for the Democratic Party as well as the 2020 presidential race in general.
TITLE=> G-20 Protests. ARTICLE=> Several violent protests have erupted at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.
TITLE=> Democrats Introduce Significant Police Reform Legislation. ARTICLE=> A coalition of the Congressional Black Caucus, House Judiciary Committee Democrats and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) led the introduction of legislation Monday aimed at increasing transparency and accountability within police departments and police affairs nationwide. Reporting throughout the spectrum focused on the specifics of the bill, including provisions to limit the use of lethal force and implement a national registry tracking police misconduct. Coverage from right-rated outlets framed rising "defund the police" movements as misguided, and criticized Democratic leaders who were supposedly sidestepping questions on the matter.
TITLE=> FDA Authorizes Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it approved Pfizer's COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine on Friday evening, with inoculations expected to begin as early as Monday. Pfizer's trials showed the vaccine to be 95% effective in preventing the virus. Currently, the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older; healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities will be the first recipients of the initial 2.9 million doses administered. If Moderna's vaccine is approved next week, more vaccine administration is expected to follow. President Donald Trump tweeted a video celebrating the Pfizer vaccine's authorization, praising his administration's Operation Warp Speed, and repeating claims that China spread the coronavirus. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the vaccine inoculation and distribution, while right-rated outlets also tended to highlight the role that Trump and Operation Warp Speed played in vaccine development.
TITLE=> Trump Proposes $4.7 Trillion Budget for 2020. ARTICLE=> President Trump proposed a $4.7 trillion budget for fiscal year 2020, which includes significant cuts to domestic programs, as well as increased military spending and $8.6 billion for a border wall.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Cuban Protests. ARTICLE=> Protests that broke out over the weekend against Cuba’s government continued on Monday in some cities, including Tampa, Florida. Cuban anti-government activists said that over 100 people were arrested or missing as of Tuesday. Among those detained was Spanish journalist Camila Acosta, whose release was demanded by the Spanish government on Tuesday. The events also strained relations between the governments of the U.S. and Cuba, with President Joe Biden expressing support for the protesters, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel accusing the U.S. of stoking social unrest in Cuba, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken replying, “It would be a grievous mistake for the Cuban regime to interpret what is happening…as a result or product of anything the United States has done.” Voices in right-rated outlets used the protests to criticize progressive Democrats and tended to see the protests as a rejection of ideologies like communism and socialism. Voices in left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus more on material issues in Cuba like electricity cuts, food shortages and restrictions on free speech.
TITLE=> President Trump Withdraws U.S. Troops from Syria. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump announced late Sunday that U.S. troops would leave the Turkey-Syria border ahead of a planned Turkish military offensive, saying the U.S. had accomplished his goals in defeating ISIS. The U.S. formally began fighting ISIS on Syrian soil in 2014. Outlets from all sides of the political spectrum reported on bipartisan criticism of Trump's decision, headlined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) disapproval; left-leaning outlets focused more on Republican criticisms, while some right-leaning outlets concentrated on Trump's subsequent defense of the decision. Some reported late Monday on alleged Turkish attacks on Kurdish and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) troops following the withdrawal.
TITLE=> Trump Reportedly Edges Closer to Firing Sessions and Rosenstein. ARTICLE=> The Wall Street Journal broke a report that President Trump is edging closer to firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein over frustration with the Russia probe.

ARTICLE=> The Obama administration allegedly gave Iran a license to access the U.S. financial system after striking the nuclear deal, despite public officials' promises that this wouldn't happen, according to a new report by Senate Republicans. The plan never came to fruition, as two U.S. banks would not participate.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Students, Safety and Closing Schools This Fall. ARTICLE=> As COVID-19 coronavirus cases rise in many parts of the United States, local leaders are mulling over whether to close schools and how to keep students safe while continuing the school year. Many voices on all sides agree that students learn best when physically in a classroom. Right-rated voices argue that school closures are unnecessary, and concentrate on data suggesting that COVID-19 risks for school-age children are generally lower overall than for other age groups. Some left-rated voices, while acknowledging similar facts, argue that the federal government has not yet given sufficient guidance for schools to reopen safely. Another focus of coverage on all sides was Dr. Anthony Fauci's statement Monday that "if you have a choice between closing the schools and closing the bars, close the bars."
TITLE=> Sessions Cracks Down on Marijuana. ARTICLE=> Jeff Sessions is expected to crack down on marijuana use, even in states where it has already been legalized.

TITLE=> Government to Buy 200M More Vaccine Doses. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden announced plans Tuesday to purchase 200 million more COVID-19 vaccine doses, attempting to guarantee vaccination for at least 300 million Americans by the fall. Biden's administration will buy 100 million doses each of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine, raising the current U.S. supply to about 600 million doses (both vaccine variants require two doses). Biden also explained plans to boost weekly vaccine distribution to states, and to better coordinate the allocations. Coverage was similar throughout the political spectrum. Neither side of the media seemed to adopt a biased narrative around the announcement.

TITLE=> Several Advertisers Pull Ads From Fox News Programs Hosted by Pirro, Carlson. ARTICLE=> Several advertisers have reportedly pulled their ads from Fox News programs hosted by Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro.

Ilhan Omar's hijab shows that she adheres to Sharia law.
TITLE=> Parents of Otto Warmbier Denounce Trump Comments, Say Kim Jong Un Is Responsible for Son's Death. ARTICLE=> The parents of Otto Warmbier are pushing back on President Trump's assertion that Kim Jong Un was uninvolved in their son's death, saying that "Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto" and that "no lavish praise can change that." Editors note: we change the headline from "... say North Korea is Responsible" to "... say Kim Jong Un is Responsible". Trump and the family agree that North Korea is responsible and that Kim Jong Un is responsible for the regime there. This disagreement comes from Trump saying that he believed Kim Jong Un when he said that he did not personally know about it.
TITLE=> Homeland Security Secretary Almost Quit After Trump Border Rant. ARTICLE=> Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen “was close to resigning” from President Trump’s administration after she was blasted for failing to secure the U.S.-Mexico border against a caravan of Central Americans, a report says.

ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump revealed Monday that he's been taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic for the COVID-19 coronavirus, inciting a media firestorm and a flurry of diverse reactions from throughout the political spectrum. Many left-rated voices were critical of the president and explicit about warning against use of the drug, while some on the right instead criticized the media's purported exaggeration of the situation. Other voices from left to right suggested the announcement was a ploy by the president to distract the media from his virus management; some also spent time investigating the pros, cons and potential side effects of using the drug.
TITLE=> U.S. Carries Out First Federal Execution in 17 Years. ARTICLE=> The Justice Department has put to death Daniel Lee, 47, marking the first federal execution in 17 years, just hours after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against a last-minute attempt to halt the execution.

He had waited more than 20 years on federal death row in Terre Haute, Indiana.
TITLE=> Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta Resigns. ARTICLE=> Labor Secretary Alex Acosta has resigned amid controversy over his secret 2008 plea deal with accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. President Donald Trump publicly supported Acosta's decision to resign.
TITLE=> US Intelligence Reportedly Anticipated Coronavirus Pandemic. ARTICLE=> A report on Friday in the Washington Post alleged that U.S. intelligence agencies had warned about a likely coronavirus pandemic as early as January, contradicting statements by President Donald Trump and other lawmakers that sought to downplay the crisis. Citing "U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting," the Post wrote that classified warnings from agencies like the CIA and the State Department "did track the spread of the virus in China, and later in other countries, and warned that Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak." Reporting on the issue has been limited to some left- and center- rated outlets, with one right-rated publication covering the story as of Sunday morning.

TITLE=> One Capitol Police Officer and Suspect Dead After Vehicle Attack. ARTICLE=> One Capitol police officer was killed and another was injured after being rammed by a car at the U.S. Capitol building Friday. Washington Metro police said there is no clear motive for the attack yet, and that it "does not appear to be terrorism-related." Police reportedly shot and killed the driver after he brandished a knife and ran toward them. The suspect was identified as a 25-year old man from Indiana who was not previously known to Capitol or D.C. Metro authorities; the suspect's Facebook page showed him to be a follower of the Nation of Islam, according to multiple reports. Coverage on all sides focused on reactions from the political world, and recalled the deadly chaos at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. Reports from right-rated outlets focused much more on the suspect's background and speculation about a possible motive.

ARTICLE=> Hours-long waiting lines, malfunctioning voting machines and supposedly poorly trained election workers reportedly plagued a messy primary election day in Georgia on Tuesday. Many voting rights groups and activists also concluded that the worst of these problems were most present in black voting districts, including Atlanta's voting precincts. Some prominent voices including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and basketball star LeBron James spoke up about black voter suppression amid the disarray. Few right-rated outlets covered the reported issues with Georgia's primary. Many left- and center-rated sources reported prominently on the process, with some labeling it a "hot mess."

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Syria Air Strike. ARTICLE=> After receiving criticism for his recent airstrike against Iranian-backed militia groups in Syria, President Joe Biden penned a letter Saturday to congressional leadership, arguing the strike was consistent with the U.S. right to self-defense. Lawmakers on both sides criticized the Biden administration for the strike, arguing military action without congressional approval is unconstitutional. Those lawmakers included Republican Reps. Nancy Mace, Jim Banks, Rand Paul, and Lauren Boebert; and Democratic senators Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy, as well as Representatives Ro Khanna and Ilhan Omar. Those who support the president's decision, however, contend that Biden's approach struck a balance between protecting U.S. military troops and potentially "reopening conversation" with Iran. Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Tom Cotton and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, expressed support for the air strike. On Sunday, Iran rejected the  European Union's offer to arrange nuclear talks with the U.S. Coverage from across the political spectrum highlighted lawmakers' reactions of criticism and of support for the air strike, and some provided analysis as to what the air strike means for foreign relations going forward.
TITLE=> Obama Suggests US Lacks Leadership on Coronavirus in Commencement Address. ARTICLE=> In a two-hour video address to the graduating class of 74 historically black colleges across the country on Saturday, former President Barack Obama critiqued the current administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying many officials "aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” It's the second time in a month that the Democrat has weighed in on the country's handling of the crisis, after a private conference call leaked in which he called it "an absolute chaotic disaster." Outlets on the left and right tended to focus on Obama's implicit criticism in their coverage, with many using loaded words like "rips" and "attacks" to describe his comments. Those in the center reported more generally on the contents of the speech.
TITLE=> Marco Rubio Expresses Doubts About Tax Bill. ARTICLE=> Marco Rubio expressed concern about the recently passed GOP tax bill in a new interview, stating that the plan went too far in helping corporations.

TITLE=> Offer to Fund Border Wall Withdrawn. ARTICLE=> After Senator Schumer rescinds an offer to fund the border wall, President Trump responds that there will be no DACA deal.
TITLE=> COVID-19 Booster Shots to Begin Soon for Certain Adults After CDC Recommendation. ARTICLE=> CDC Director Rochelle Walensky recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster shot Thursday for people ages 65 and older, as well as adults at high risk of severe COVID-19. Walensky's nod followed a similar recommendation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panel; the panel's 15 advisers unanimously supported the shots for ages 65+, and voted 13-2 to endorse giving Pfizer's booster to people ages 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions. Advisers voted 9-6 against endorsing the booster for ages 18-49, with the majority citing concerns about the lack of evidence supporting the recommendation. But Walensky disagreed, and officially recommended the shot for high-risk workers in that age group. Tens of million Americans may be eligible for the shots; roughly 55% of Americans are fully vaccinated. 	Coverage on all sides highlighted how the recommendations are a much narrower version of the Biden administration's original plan to get booster shots to anyone who wanted them by Sept. 20. Some reports from left-rated sources cast doubt on the extra shots' ability to curb the pandemic, and highlighted calls for the U.S. to focus on distributing vaccines to underdeveloped countries before offering booster shots to all Americans. Some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted the panel's emphasis on the lack of evidence for giving booster shots to people ages 18-49, and framed Walensky's decision to disagree with the CDC panel as unusual and misinformed. Updated 9/24/21 at 8:28 a.m. ET with Walensky's recommendation.

ARTICLE=> Voters in 11 states will choose their next governor Tuesday, potentially affecting state policies and congressional maps after the 2020 census. Of the 11 states, nine have incumbents running for reelection. Polls suggest Republican incumbents will hold their offices in Utah, North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana; polls also project Democratic incumbents in Washington state and Delaware to be reelected. Governor races in Montana, Missouri and North Carolina have been widely identified as races to watch. Currently, Republican governors hold a 26-24 edge in the nation. Some right-rated sources such as Reason focused specifically on Libertarian Party gubernatorial candidates.
TITLE=> What Mueller Wants to Ask Trump. ARTICLE=> Special counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year outlined for President Trump’s legal team more than 40 questions he planned to ask in a possible interview with the president as part of his investigation into Trump associates’ ties to Russia.

TITLE=> Taliban Give First Press Conference Since Taking Over Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> In the Taliban's first press conference since it took control of Afghanistan, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid described how the militant organization would run the country in accordance with Islamic law. Mujahid pledged that women would be "very active within our society, within our framework," said that "nobody will be harmed in Afghanistan," promised not to launch attacks on the U.S. or other nations from Afghan soil, and said "media should not work against national values and national unity," according to translations provided by multiple media outlets. Many in Afghanistan, the U.S. and across the world remain skeptical of the Taliban's willingness to protect individual freedoms, with many recalling the behavioral restrictions and public violence against women that characterized the late-1990's Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Since the takeover, reports have emerged of the Taliban searching homes in Afghanistan for signs of dissention or U.S. allies. 	Mujahid's comments made headlines across the spectrum Tuesday; the press conference was featured less prominently by right-rated outlets, while being highlighted atop the homepages of major left- and center-rated outlets including NBC News (Lean Left bias), Associated Press (Center) and Reuters (Center). Many headlines focused on the spokesman's comments about women's rights "under Islamic law."
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Address To Congress. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday night, President Joe Biden outlined an ambitious, active role for government in his first speech to Congress. Many Democrats are pleased with the push toward big government and liberal policies that they believe will help working class Americans.

TITLE=> Trump Says US Will Remain 'Steadfast Partner' of Saudi Arabia, No New Punishment for Journalist Jamal Khashoggi's Murder. ARTICLE=> President Trump announced that the US will remain a "steadfast partner" of Saudi Arabia, signaling there will be no new punishment for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.

TITLE=> Apple Moves Production of Mac Pro to China. ARTICLE=> Apple will move the production of its high-end computer, the Mac Pro, to China, according to sources familiar with Apple's manufacturing plans. The Mac Pro was the only major Apple device assembled in the U.S. The move comes amid heightened trade talks between the U.S. and China. The Mac Pro is not intended for the mass market, but rather, for companies and individuals with specialized needs — it sells for $6,000. Apple had been manufacturing Mac Pros in Austin, Texas, but could not find enough skilled labor willing to work for minimum wage, according to the Wall Street Journal.
TITLE=> The State of Coronavirus Testing in the US. ARTICLE=> The state of COVID-19 coronavirus testing in the United States has quickly become a politicized focal point, both for White House press briefings and media coverage. Roughly 0.2 percent of the U.S. population had been tested as of Friday. News coverage from many media outlets has framed the state of coronavirus testing in the U.S. in a critical light. Some outlets focused on fact-checking the president's statements about testing, and purported FDA missteps in preparing the U.S. for a pandemic; some right-rated outlets have focused on recent statements from the Trump administration and federal health officials that more tests are becoming available and being conducted, due in part to private sector production.
TITLE=> Judge Blocks Extension of Illinois Stay-at-home Order. ARTICLE=> An Illinois judge has blocked Gov. J.B. Pritzker's effort to extend the state's stay-at-home order past the initial 30 days. The judge granted a temporary restraining order to state Rep. Darren Bailey, who argued that the rural lifestyle of his constituents already hinders the spread of disease, and suggested orders need only apply to Chicago and its suburbs. A review of the case is ongoing; Pritzker (D) reportedly accused Bailey of being “blindly devoted to ideology and the pursuit of personal celebrity." While the temporary injunction is only applicable to the petitioner, experts predict that precedent may be set if others file suit. State Attorney General Kwame Raoul (D) has appealed the court's decision.
TITLE=> Economists on School Choice. ARTICLE=> The New York Times published a story implying that most economists are against school choice, but review of the original data tells a different story. Media bias, deception, or a fair, balanced reading of the data?
TITLE=> As Riots Persist, Public Ponders Their Effectiveness. ARTICLE=> Protests and demonstrations continued to devolve into chaos throughout the U.S. Friday night, as people took to the streets to oppose the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd. Floyd died after being forcefully restrained by a now-former police officer who's been charged with third-degree murder. The riots involved arson, looting and physical violence in several large U.S. cities. Some left-rated voices said the riots and violence were an inevitable consequence of insufficient police reforms and purportedly systemic racism in U.S. criminal justice. Some right-rated voices expressed support for the right to protest, but lamented violent rioters and criticized local leadership and law enforcement for purportedly enabling the unrest.
TITLE=> White House Drops Call to Raise Guns Age Limit. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said he would wait for the courts to rule before acting on raising the minimum age for some gun purchases, putting off one of the more contentious gun safety measures he had backed after the latest U.S. school shooting.
TITLE=> Trump Admin Suspends Certain Visas Through End of 2020. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration announced Monday that it will suspend certain foreign work visas until the end of 2020 to help the U.S. economy recover from the COVID-19 coronavirus and benefit American workers. Coverage from left-rated sources generally concentrated more on big business and the tech industry's supposed opposition to the ban, while some coverage from right-rated outlets reported that white collar professionals lobbied on behalf of the move. Right-rated sources also tended to highlight the fact that the move is expected to free up at least 525,000 jobs for American workers.
TITLE=> House Democrats Return to Advance $3.5T Budget Plan. ARTICLE=> U.S. House Democrats are returning to Washington D.C. Monday to advance President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion budget plan.  Democratic House leadership plans to approve a "rule" on Monday to set up a vote on Tuesday. Democrats in the House are currently working to string together votes from nine moderate Democrats who want the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill recently passed by the Senate to pass the House before taking up the budget package.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) can lose only three of the Senate's 50 Democratic votes before the $3.5 trillion bill is defeated.
TITLE=> Trump Team Submits Written Answers To Questions From Mueller. ARTICLE=> President Trump has provided the special counsel with written answers to questions pertaining to the probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
TITLE=> Record Number of Job Openings in US, but Companies Struggling to Hire. ARTICLE=> The Labor Department announced Tuesday that there were 9.3 million job openings in the U.S., the highest amount since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking the data in 2000. This beat widely-cited economists' predictions of 8.3 million, suggesting that demand for employees is surging as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, there have been widespread reports of businesses struggling to fill openings, and May was the second straight month that U.S. hiring fell short of expectations. 	The economic recovery, especially as measured by rates of hiring and unemployment, has been covered frequently across the spectrum. Coverage from right-rated sources tended to blame increased unemployment assistance for purportedly discouraging people from returning to work; some voices also criticized the Biden administration's purportedly over-generous stance on unemployment benefits. Conversely, some reports from left-rated outlets highlighted incentives companies are using to attract new employees; others pointed to workplace safety concerns and struggles to find child care arrangements as possible reasons for public reluctance to return to work.
TITLE=> House Democrats Unveil $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Plan. ARTICLE=> House Democrats unveiled the 591-page text of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19  relief package on Friday, which includes $1,400 direct payments, an extension of $400 federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. Though Democrat leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said they expect their party-led chambers to pass the bill within the next few weeks, the Senate expects some division over certain aspects of the bill such as a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage. The House Budget Committee plans to meet Monday to go over the legislation. Coverage from the left and center tended to focus on the contents of the bill, and provide analysis and predictions about it. Some voices from the right criticized the bill, saying it could slow economic recovery in the long run and prevent “the expanding economy from reaching low-wage workers.”
TITLE=> Elon Musk Website May Track Press Credibility. ARTICLE=> Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted that he might start a website where "the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility" of journalists and press.

TITLE=> US Sets Daily Record of New Coronavirus Cases. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the COVID Tracking Project reported that the U.S. set a daily record of 36,880 new coronavirus cases. The surge in states such as Arizona, Florida and Texas cannot be explained by increased testing alone as the percentage of people testing positive for the virus has also surged.
TITLE=> Fact Checkers Explore Claim 'Black Lives Matter' Fundraising Goes to Democratic Campaigns. ARTICLE=> Circulating social media posts suggested that donations to the Black Lives Matter webpage are funding Democratic party candidates because donations go through ActBlue, a nonprofit political action committee which supports Democrats and left-leaning causes. The posts went viral over the past week, with conservative political commentators including Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk positing the claim on Twitter. Fact checking websites on all sides of the political spectrum noted that ActBlue acts as a nonprofit fundraising tool that serves as a conduit for donations, rather than as a collector; the company delivers funds to organizations or candidates targeted by the individual donor.

TITLE=> White House Suspends Billions in Obamacare Insurer Payments. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration on Saturday halted billions of dollars in payments to health insurers that are required under the Obamacare healthcare law to even out the cost to insurers whose customers need expensive medical services.

TITLE=> Perspectives: 2021 Predictions. ARTICLE=> Media outlets often publish predictions at the start of a new year. After the unexpected whirlwind that was 2020, media has proved to be more cautious this time around. Ahead of 2021, people tended to make predictions about more niche subjects like sports and technology, straying away from more controversial subjects. Some tended to be modest in their predictions for politics and culture in 2021, while others warned against making predictions during such a time. Others looked to the past to compare our advancements with predictions from a century ago. Voices from across the political spectrum offered cautiously optimistic pictures of 2021, while comparing 2020 to the predictions they gave last year and warning readers that anything could happen.
TITLE=> Evangelist Billy Graham Dies at 99. ARTICLE=> Evangelist Billy Graham, whose ministry revolutionized global evangelism, died at age 99 at his home in North Carolina.
TITLE=> Court of Appeals: Trump Cannot Block Critics on Twitter. ARTICLE=> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot "block" other users on Twitter. The ideologically diverse court decided that Twitter is a public platform where voters communicate with their elected officials. The court went on to say that any blocking of users can be deemed silencing dissent, thus infringing on the First Amendment. Left-leaning media has focused on Trump's use of Twitter to degrade opponents and foes, while also fighting in court to block users who oppose him. However, some on the left deemed the court ruling to be "unpersuasive." The right seems to hold both disappointment and enthusiasm, speculating that Trump may take this case to the Supreme Court.

Scott Walker signed a bill on Friday that will limit the powers of Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers, who defeated him in the November election. Some have accused Walker and the Wisconsin GOP of executing a last-minute power grab, while others say the new legislation will not fundamentally lessen executive authority, but will instead protect policies that Walker helped enact during his tenure.
TITLE=> Report Claims Trump Made Disparaging Remarks About Military Service Members. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, an article published in The Atlantic reported that, according to anonymous sources, President Donald Trump previously made several strongly-worded disparaging comments about military service members, including those who died during World War I. The report also alleges that in 2018 Trump asked that wounded veterans be removed from planned military parades. Trump denied making the comments on Thursday, calling the report “fake news” and suggesting the sources were “liars.” White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said the report has “no basis in fact.” The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post and others cited sources confirming Trump’s disparaging comments, including “a senior Defense Department official with firsthand knowledge of events,” “a senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump’s comments,” “a former senior administration official,” and “people familiar with Mr. Trump’s comments.” Fox News cited “two sources who were on the trip in question” refuting the claim that Trump cancelled a 2018 trip to a WWI cemetery because the dead soldiers were “suckers.” The report quickly picked up national media attention. Some outlets on all sides published the AP’s coverage. Coverage in right-rated outlets and some center- and left-rated outlets focused on Trump’s denial of the report’s allegations. Some coverage in left-rated outlets focused on the report’s claims but included Trump’s denial.

TITLE=> Marjorie Taylor Greene Apologizes for Comparing Mask Mandates, Vaccines to Holocaust. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) apologized for comparing COVID-19 mask mandates and vaccines to the Holocaust, saying "there is no comparison" between the mass genocide of 6 million people and pandemic health measures. Last month, Greene commented on a Tennessee grocery store's rule requiring employees to display their COVID-19 vaccination status, writing on Twitter that "vaccinated employees get a vaccination logo just like the Nazi’s forced Jewish people to wear a gold star." Greene defended her comments at first, saying, "I never compared it to the Holocaust, only the discrimination against Jews in early Nazi years." Greene's comments received wide criticism from across the spectrum, including from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). On Monday, Greene said she "made a mistake" and apologized for her comments after visiting the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. This comes as Rep. Brad Schneider (D.-Ill.) is expected to unveil a resolution this week that would censure Greene after similar comments last month comparing U.S. House mask rules to Nazi persecution of Jews. Greene's apology received wide coverage and criticism from across the political spectrum. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight details of Greene's speech "owning [her] mistake." Coverage from the left tended to focus on Greene's history of controversial comments.   
TITLE=> Ahmaud Arbery Killing Puts Racial Violence Under Microscope. ARTICLE=> A video reportedly showing the death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, in Georgia went viral this week. Arbery was shot and killed while jogging in February following a confrontation with two men, who suspected him of committing robberies in the surrounding neighborhood. Arbery's assailants have not been charged; the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Wednesday it would conduct a full investigation of the killing. Given the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, a grand jury could not be selected to evaluate the presumptive case until mid-June. Voices throughout the political spectrum were mostly unified in condemning the killing, which many paint as an example of racism and racial profiling; Arbery was black, his killers white. Many media reports highlighted high-profile calls for justice, including those from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Democratic Nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden, who are often seen as being on opposite ends of the Democratic party.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Breaking Down the UN Report on Human-Caused Climate Change. ARTICLE=> The United Nations' recent report on human-caused climate change revived the debate over how serious an issue climate change is, and how drastically humanity should act on it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report Monday saying the Earth could cross a critical temperature threshold in the next 10 years, roughly a decade sooner than previously thought; the report also showed that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere reached a 2 million-year high in 2019. The report frames sharp cuts of greenhouse gas emissions as the only way to stunt more global warming. Many voices on the left described the situation as dire, often framing the report's data about rising global temperatures in the context of recent heatwaves and wildfires. Some voices on the left and in the center also emphasized parts of the report that give reason for optimism, such as points about how reducing methane pollution could purportedly have immediate positive effects. Voices on the right often framed the UN report as overdramatic and lacking historical context, and criticized the media for purportedly exaggerating the seriousness of climate change; some highlighted how the report mentions that U.S. heat waves have become more common since 1960, but doesn't directly address that they're no more frequent today than they were in 1900. Some voices in the center also focused on initiatives aimed at finding common ground on the environment among Americans.
TITLE=> MGM Settles With Vegas Shooting Survivors. ARTICLE=> Las Vegas casino titan MGM Grand has reached a settlement worth up to $800 million with survivors of last year's infamous shooting at its Mandalay Bay resort, which killed 58 and wounded roughly 700.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Where Do Biden, Trump Stand In Polls?. ARTICLE=> Election polling has always played a central role in the months leading up to a presidential election. According to several key national polls, including the Grinnell College/Selzer and Co. poll, the Reuters/IPSOS poll and the CNN/SSRS poll released at the beginning of September, Joe Biden has an average 8-point lead over President Donald Trump. Though Biden's own numbers did not spike after the Democratic National Convention (DNC), Trump saw a small bump after the Republican National Convention (RNC) in swing state Florida, putting him at 3 points behind Biden. Arizona has Biden up by around five points, and Biden leads by a 6-7 point average in Michigan and Wisconsin; this makes for an average 5-point margin in key Electoral College swing states. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the narrower numbers in swing states. Some center- and right-rated outlets framed Trump's numbers as a negative reflection on his new "law and order" focus. Some left-rated outlets used flat convention bumps to question the necessity of party conventions.
TITLE=> Treasury Releases Report on Taxes. ARTICLE=> The US Treasury released a report on the GOP tax cuts asserting that the increase in the federal deficit will be offset by the remaining economic policy initiatives in President Trump's agenda. Many Right-leaning media outlets highlighted the Treasury's conclusion, while several Left-leaning publications emphasized that the tax plan will not pay for itself entirely.

TITLE=> Coverage of Press Secretary's "Science" Remark Fails to Give Full Picture. ARTICLE=> White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was the subject of mass media coverage Thursday after a remark she made during a briefing on reopening schools and public safety. McEnany said "science should not stand in the way" of reopening schools, before saying "science is on our side here, and we encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science" a few moments later. Many left-rated outlets offered only the incomplete quote in their reports, and framed headlines around the assertion that McEnany moved to discredit science. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused on the full quote, often criticizing misleading coverage from left-leaning media and CNN reporter Jim Acosta's viral tweet that only gave a part of McEnany's full statement; the tweet in question was retweeted 44,000 times, and Acosta's follow-up tweet giving the rest of McEnany's quote amassed roughly 800 retweets. Center-rated outlets were split; some sought to provide the full context, others reported only on the first part of the quote. McEnany called the situation a "case study in media bias" via Twitter; Acosta and others also fielded criticism from fellow CNN journalist Jake Tapper, who asked the public to read McEnany's whole comment and called on reporters to "be fair".
TITLE=> FBI Report Shows US Murder Rate Increased Nearly 30 Percent In 2020. ARTICLE=> The U.S. experienced a 29.4 percent increase in murders in 2020 compared to the previous year, marking the largest spike since national records were instituted in 1960. According to new figures released Monday by the FBI, there were an estimated 21,570 homicides in the United States last year — 4,901 more than recorded in 2019. Preliminary data also suggests that the murder rate has continued to grow in 2021, but has slowed down as the year progresses. Several cities across the midwest such as Albuquerque, Des Moines, Memphis and Milwaukee logged their highest homicide rate ever. Although the FBI noted an overall 5.6 percent increase in overall violent crimes, 2020 marked the 18th consecutive year where property crimes have declined. Since 2,722 of the eligible 18,619 law enforcement agencies didn't submit their numbers to the FBI last year, the data remains incomplete. Numbers and data stayed consistent across the spectrum, with some outlets comparing the murder rates to other countries. Right-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize the George Floyd "riots" and the "drop in morale among law enforcement" as the main agent of violence. Some left-rated voices called last year an "aberration," indicating that these increasing numbers are "not indicative of a longer-term trend."
TITLE=> GDP Climbs Above 4 Percent. ARTICLE=> The US economy grew at the strongest pace in nearly four years during the second quarter, powered by a rebound in consumer spending, exports and firm business investment.
TITLE=> COVID-19 Takes a Toll on Working Families. ARTICLE=> At the time of this writing, it has been 307 days since the first recorded case of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Since then, over 46.7 million people have contracted the coronavirus, including over 9.2 million in the U.S. alone. This has led to over 1.2 million reported deaths worldwide, including over 230,000 in the U.S. The U.S. Census Bureau's most recent Household Pulse Survey suggests that 23.6% of American households expect a loss in employment income in the next four weeks. Furthermore, about 10% of households face food scarcity and about 7% face housing insecurity. Outlets on all sides have reported on the impact of the pandemic on nearly every facet of life, including the economy, housing, schools, families, social justice, and even the news media itself.
TITLE=> Paul Manafort's Former Business Partner Testifies that the Two Committed Tax and Bank Fraud. ARTICLE=> Rick Gates, the ex-business partner of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, testified at Manafort's criminal trial on Monday that the two committed tax and bank fraud, admitting to stealing money from secret overseas bank accounts.
TITLE=> Senate Impeachment Trial to Start in Early February. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives will transmit an article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate on Monday, and the formal trial will begin in the Senate the week of Feb. 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Friday. His announcement of the article's transmission initially appeared to be a denial of Republicans' requests to delay the trial, but he later explained that the Senate would pause the trial until early February once transmitting the impeachment article Monday. The news was often framed as benefitting both parties by media outlets across the spectrum. Some framed it as a win for the Biden administration based on the extra time it would have to settle in and confirm Cabinet members before a polarizing impeachment trial; others framed it as a win for the GOP, which had originally wanted to delay the trial by several weeks. Some coverage from right-rated sources also focused on President Joe Biden's apparent approval of the delay. Updated 1/22/21 at 6:58 p.m. ET with trial's start date.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Declines to Hear Transgender Bathroom Case. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case regarding a Virginia school board's policy on transgender students' bathroom use. In 2015, transgender student Gavin Grimm sued the Gloucester County school board after it banned Grimm from using the boys' restroom. The board attempted to appeal last year's ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; the ruling said transgender students are protected under Title IX , which bans sex discrimination in education. The court did not give a reason for its rejection; Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have taken on the case. This comes after the Supreme Court last year expanded the definition of discrimination on the basis of "sex” in the workplace to include “gender identity" and "sexual orientation." Earlier this month, the Education Department also expanded the definition of the federal sex discrimination ban to include "gender identity," citing the Supreme Court's 2020 ruling. The story received wide coverage across the spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight quotes from Grimm and from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who represented Grimm. Some right-rated outlets also highlighted the Supreme Court's 2020 ruling and the Education Department's announcement, placing it in the context of the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes in women's sports. 
TITLE=> Trump Pushes For Border Wall Prior To Meeting With Top Democrats. ARTICLE=> President Trump suggests that he may utilize the military to build the border wall ahead of a meeting with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.
TITLE=> Trump Fires Defense Secretary Mark Esper. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday and announced Christopher Miller,  previously the National Counterterrorism Center director, as acting defense secretary in a tweet. Though shifting Pentagon priorities and rising tension in the White House suggested Esper's exit for some time, Esper told Military Times that he had no intention of quitting. Trump's termination of Esper raises questions about the actions the president might take during the next few months in the White House, in anticipation of projected winner Joe Biden taking office. Coverage from across the political spectrum tended to focus on Esper's history in the White House, as well as speculation about Trump's potential actions between now and January.
TITLE=> 190,000 Migrant Encounters In June Mark 21-Year High. ARTICLE=> The  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said Friday there were nearly 190,000 migrant encounters at the southern border in June, bringing the total number of migrant encounters for the 2021 fiscal year to more than 1 million. June's numbers also mark the highest number of monthly border encounters since 223,000 migrant encounters were recorded in March 2000. Last June, there were 33,049 migrant encounters; the number of encounters with unaccompanied children also increased from 14,137 in May to 15,253 in June. The CBP said 104,907 migrants were expelled last month under Title 42, a Trump-era public health order that returns migrants to Mexico without the opportunity to claim asylum, and that the higher number of migrant encounters is likely due to repeat encounters with those expelled under Title 42. Some media outlets have reported that the Biden administration plans to end the policy on July 31.  The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum; outlets on the left and center tended to focus on the number of migrants, while some outlets on the right highlighted widespread criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the border. 
TITLE=> US Added 916,000 Jobs in March. ARTICLE=> U.S. employers added 916,000 jobs in March, and the unemployment rate dropped to 6%, according to the Labor Department.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The US and Afghan Refugees. ARTICLE=> As the U.S. continues to sort out the mess in Afghanistan, tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are seeking safety by fleeing the country. The U.S. and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun accepting refugees, placing them at domestic military bases; the Pentagon said last week that roughly 20,000 refugees were already at U.S. bases. The State Department reportedly notified nonprofit organizations that help settle refugees this week that up to 50,000 more refugees in need of resettlement may soon arrive; it also expanded a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program for Iraqis and Afghans who helped the U.S. military to issue an additional 8,000 visas. 	The idea of welcoming Afghan refugees has united some voices across political divides. Voices on both left and right have advocated the importance of the U.S. protecting Afghans with a smooth immigration process, particularly children and people who aided the U.S. military and now may face Taliban retribution. Some left-rated voices called for congressional action to ensure that refugees have assurances, such as an opportunity for permanent U.S. residence or reunification with family members who were left behind. Right-rated voices also focused on how refugees are being processed, where they're being kept, and what sort of measures the federal government is taking to make sure refugees are kept track of; some also highlighted claims that the State Department is holding up private charter flights carrying Americans and refugees from leaving Afghanistan.
TITLE=> CDC Says Unvaccinated People Are Twice As Likely To Face COVID-19 Reinfection. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a new study on Friday that found those who have recovered from COVID-19 and have not been vaccinated were 2.34 times more likely to be reinfected than those who were fully vaccinated. The study examined the risk of reinfection among hundreds of Kentucky residents during May and June who tested positive for the virus in 2020. “If you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement. The study did not examine the severity of the reinfections, and the authors noted that there are still many unknown factors such as how long natural immunity to the virus lasts. Voices from across the political spectrum pointed to the success of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths. Left-rated voices were more likely to mention the Biden administration's push to increase vaccinations amid the spread of the Delta variant. 
TITLE=> YouTube Expands Policy on Banning 'Harmful' Vaccine Content. ARTICLE=> YouTube on Wednesday announced a sizable expansion of its medical misinformation policies, which includes banning all content about vaccines that pose "a serious risk of egregious harm" to its viewers. Any videos that "falsely says that approved vaccines cause autism, cancer or infertility, or that substances in vaccines can track those who receive them" will also be censored. Personal testimonies will be allowed as long as they do not violate the community guidelines. The platform will terminate channels belonging to Erin Elizabeth, Joseph Mercola, Sherri Tenpenny and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — four individuals that the Center for Countering Digital Hate has affiliated with "The Disinformation Dozen" — for purportedly playing leading roles in spreading COVID-19 vaccine misinformation online. Certain countries such as Russia have pushed back against YouTube's restrictions, threatening to block the video platform altogether unless they revive two German-language channels ran by their state media company RT that were deleted after sharing what YouTube dubbed as COVID-19 misinformation. Since last year, the Google-owned platform has already removed over 130,000 "dangerous" videos that violated its COVID-19 vaccine policies. According to a recent study from Pew Research Center, about one in five Americans (22%) say they regularly get news from YouTube.  Coverage across the spectrum prominently highlighted YouTube's new policies Wednesday. Left-and-center rated outlets were more likely to highlight how YouTube is the latest social media platform to follow the White House's plea to censor "The Disinformation Dozen" and other sources of vaccine misinformation. Right-rated outlets reemphasized other related instances, such as when YouTube suspended Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for claiming cloth masks are ineffective against COVID-19. 
TITLE=> Devin Nunes Sues Twitter, Users for Over $250M Alleging Bias Against Conservatives. ARTICLE=> Rep.

TITLE=> Military Leaders Defend Afghanistan Withdrawal, Contradict Biden in Senate Hearing. ARTICLE=> Top U.S. military leaders defended the withdrawal from Afghanistan in a Congressional hearing Tuesday morning. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, the nation's top military officer, is appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday and the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and U.S. Central Command Gen. Kenneth McKenzie. All three recommended that 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, which contradicts previous statements from President Joe Biden. During Tuesday's hearing, Milley also defended two calls he made to China's top general during the Trump administration amid recent reports that he acted to limit Trump's nuclear powers and wanted to quell Chinese concerns about a potential U.S. attack. The testimonies made headlines across the spectrum Tuesday morning. Coverage across the spectrum, especially from right-rated sources, framed the withdrawal as botched and harsh questioning of military leaders as necessary. Some right-rated outlets highlighted the possible disconnect between the Pentagon and top Biden administration leaders, and how miscommunication and hastiness on the part of Biden may have made the Afghanistan pullout worse. Some left-rated sources highlighted how Milley will face questions on Trump; a headline from CNN (Left bias) said Milley's testimony may "put Trump's political storms on full display." Updated 5:54 p.m. on 9/28/21

TITLE=> Taiwan President Stands Up To China, Says Country Won’t ‘Bow To Pressure’. ARTICLE=> Taiwan President Tsai Ing-we said Sunday during the country's National Day celebrations that she would not “bow to pressure” from China.“We will do our utmost to prevent the status quo from being unilaterally altered,” Ing-wen said. The Taiwanese leader also pledged to continue bolstering the island’s military defenses as well as resisting “the path China has laid out for us.” Her comments came a day after China’s President Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to "join hands" with his nation for a “peaceful reunification.” Tsai argued that life under Chinese Communist Party rule wouldn't offer "neither a free and democratic way of life for Taiwan, nor sovereignty for our 23 million people." China has tried to claim Taiwan as part of its national territory; the island nation has been independent of mainland rule since the Chinese Civil War concluded in 1949. Coverage was mostly consistent across the spectrum, with most outlets highlighting how the State Department called on China “to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan.” Left-rated outlets highlighted how "Taiwan has steadily expanded its international presence over the last few years," detailing its economic growth and intentions to "work towards net zero emissions by 2050." Right-rated outlets emphasized how the majority of countries across the globe don't recognize Taiwan as an official country.
TITLE=> Democrats Demand Attorney General Release Full Mueller Report.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Pursuit of Clean Energy. ARTICLE=> Clean energy is a hot topic as the Biden administration ramps up efforts to enact environmentally-friendly policies and eliminate energy sources that emit greenhouse gases. Net-zero emissions is often seen as the path to promoting a more sustainable world industry, but questions remain about green energy costs and job creation in the United States. Some voices writing in left-rated outlets have stressed a need for more urgency around clean energy efforts and described detailed plans to reach net-zero emissions worldwide. Some perspectives from right-rated sources have explored how clean energy is sometimes wasted, and have explained how some green energy efforts are overly costly or challenging.
TITLE=> President’s Speech to Police Officers. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Trump gave a speech to a group of police officers that received a lot of media backlash. In his speech, the President told police officers, "please don't be too nice," and referred to members of the MS-13 gang as "animals." Sources such as Vox and Vanity Fair claimed that the speech was "alarming" and "fearmongering." In response, Fox News released an article claiming that these sources were being biased in favor of gang members.

TITLE=> Trump Returns to Campaigning; Doctor Says He is 'No Longer Contagious'. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail by holding an event at the White House Saturday, just over a week since he tested positive for the virus. Trump spoke from a balcony to several hundred supporters, saying he was "feeling great." On Saturday evening, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump was no longer considered a transmission risk to others, but didn’t say whether Trump has tested negative for the virus yet. Conley said diagnostic tests show there is “no longer evidence of actively replicating virus.”  Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on Conley's memo saying that Trump was not contagious. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed Conley's statement as false; other voices from the left speculate that the Saturday White House event may cause another virus outbreak.
TITLE=> White House Blasts NYT Trump Tax Fraud Claims. ARTICLE=> The White House blasts the New York Times piece that claims Donald Trump helped his parents evade paying taxes.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Renters Celebrate Eviction Ban as Landlords Plan Legal Challenges. ARTICLE=> A moratorium on evictions throughout most of the U.S. has created opposing narratives across the spectrum. The Biden administration announced an eviction moratorium in all U.S. counties that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rates as having "substantial" or "high" levels of COVID-19 transmission; as of Thursday, roughly 83% of U.S. counties meet those criteria. The new ban comes after the previous nationwide moratorium expired over the weekend, which was first issued in Sept. 2020 and extended after it expired in July. Congress allocated more than $46 billion in pandemic relief funds for rental assistance; roughly 93% of that money has yet to be dispersed to renters and landlords. The ban has divided news outlets and commentators on left and right. Reports and perspectives from left-rated sources often focused on struggling renters and how the ban would help alleviate their financial stress. Coverage from right-rated sources often highlighted struggling landlords who are unable to collect rent and are planning legal challenges to the ban; some also recalled Biden's comments from earlier this week in which he said the White House lacked legal authority to extend the ban. Voices across the spectrum have questioned the ban's legality; right-rated voices have been quicker to condemn it as unlawful.
TITLE=> NPR Report on Donald Trump Jr. Draws Scrutiny. ARTICLE=> A report published by NPR claiming that Donald Trump Jr. lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 and contradicted Michael Cohen's recent account of real estate efforts in Russia has drawn scrutiny from some right-leaning sources for being misleading, as the article eliminates a portion of the transcript where Trump Jr. admits that then-candidate Trump was pursuing a project in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.

ARTICLE=> Ahead of his rescheduled rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted that potential "protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes" would "not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!" Coverage from many left- and center-rated outlets referred to the tweet as a "threat," with some framing it in the context of the Juneteenth commemoration. Coverage from right-rated sources generally referred to the tweet as a "warning." Tulsa's imposition of a curfew, reportedly to curb potentially unruly demonstrations, was also a focus of coverage throughout the media spectrum.

The city is scheduled to host the 2020 Republican National Convention (RNC) and roughly 40,000 attendees from Aug. 24-27, after it was moved from Charlotte, North Carolina. Reports on all sides of the political spectrum concentrated on public health and COVID-19 coronavirus concerns associated with such an event, as well as the recent debate between politicians and legislators about the need for face-covering mandates. Some coverage from left-rated sources focused on President Donald Trump's reported advocacy for "personal choice" when it comes to wearing masks.
TITLE=> New Hampshire Abolishes Death Penalty, Overriding Governor's Veto in Bipartisan Effort. ARTICLE=> The New Hampshire Senate voted to pass the 'anti-death penalty' bill, overriding the Governor's veto, Thursday. The New Hampshire House had already passed the bill again to override Governor Chris Sununu's veto, however, today's motion would allow the bill to become law. The bill passed by the smallest possible margin in both chambers; sixteen to eight in the upper house, with both Republicans and Democrats voting on each side of the measure. New Hampshire has not executed anyone since 1939, and only has one person on death row- Michael Addison. It is unclear as to whether Addison's life will be spared given the new law.
TITLE=> Biden to End Support for Saudi-Led Attacks in Yemen. ARTICLE=> National security adviser Jake Sullivan announced Thursday morning that President Joe Biden would end American support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s offensive operations against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict has contributed to a humanitarian crisis in the country over the last five years, leaving millions without food, water or electricity. Biden is also reportedly expected to name Timothy Lenderking, a career diplomat with experience in the region, as a new special envoy for Yemen. The announcements also come roughly two weeks after Biden directed the State Department to review the Trump administration’s decision to label the Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization.

TITLE=> US COVID-19 Cases Rise, COVID-Related Deaths Decrease. ARTICLE=> New U.S. COVID-19 cases rose to an average of 23,600 per day on Monday amid the spread of the Delta variant. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the number of cases has more than doubled from the 11,300 recorded on June 23. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report Friday estimated 55.6% of Americans received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and reported that COVID-related deaths have continued to decrease 25.2% compared to the previous 7-day moving average.  Coverage from the left and center tended to focus on the rising number of cases and framed the story in the context of those who decline to get vaccinated. As of Tuesday afternoon, the story received little coverage from right-rated outlets, though it was covered by the New York Post. 
TITLE=> Trump to Return to Social Media with His Own Platform. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump will return to social media in the next two to three months with his own platform, former Trump administration adviser Jason Miller told Fox News Sunday. Without offering details, Miller said Trump's new platform will "completely redefine the game" and potentially attract "tens of millions" of users. This comes after Trump was permanently suspended from social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, after the platform's executives said Trump's tweets carried the risk of "incitement of violence," and that the president encouraged his supporters to breach the Capitol on Jan. 6; during the breach, Trump tweeted support of law enforcement and asked his supporters to "remain peaceful." Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight the social media platform's reasoning for Trump's ban. Voices from the right tended to frame the ban as censorship; some outlets on the right also speculated that a social media platform created by Trump could attract many conservatives who feel their views are censored or suppressed by other social media sites.

TITLE=> Big Ten and Pac-12 Postpone Fall Football Season. ARTICLE=> The Big Ten and Pac-12 college sports conferences announced Tuesday that they will postpone football and other fall sports, citing public health concerns. The Southeastern (SEC), Atlantic Coast (ACC), and Big 12 Conferences still plan on holding fall sports seasons, including football. On Wednesday, the Big 12 announced a 10-game schedule and enhanced COVID-19 coronavirus screening protocols. News outlets on all sides covered the decisions and analyzed the effect on other conferences, other college sports, and the NFL Draft. Some center- and right-rated outlets considered the decisions’ effect on college-town economies. Some left-rated outlets analyzed the impact on student athletes’ labor organizing efforts.
TITLE=> Biden, Bush and Other Political Figures Point To Unity On 9/11 Anniversary. ARTICLE=> To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many political leaders highlighted the unity and resiliency that once helped Americans move forward. The White House shared a pre-recorded message from President Biden on Friday, calling unity "the central lesson" of the 9/11 attacks. "Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing," Biden said. "But we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation." Biden then stood alongside former presidents Barrack Obama and Bill Clinton at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on Saturday. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President George W. Bush further emphasized the significance of unity at the memorial service for the victims and heroes of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA. Harris said "we were all reminded that unity is possible in America" in the days following the 9/11 attacks. While Bush said those days of unity "seem distant from our own," that time represented "the truest version of ourselves" and "what we can be again." Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump launched a partisan attack against Biden “and his inept administration" for surrendering “in defeat” by withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. Coverage didn't differ much along partisan lines, highlighting unity over polarizing messages. This was also reflected in opinion pieces from across the spectrum.
TITLE=> Three Dead in California High School Shooting. ARTICLE=> Story updated at 5:53 p.m. EST Three people are dead after a gunman opened fire just before 8 a.m. local time Thursday at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Trump's COVID-19 Executive Actions. ARTICLE=> Perspectives across all sides of the political spectrum are split regarding the executive actions for economic relief that President Donald Trump signed on Saturday. With four different signings, the president moved to extend unemployment benefits, suspend the payroll tax for many workers, create an eviction moratorium and suspend federal student loan payments through the end of the year. Perspectives on the president's actions are largely divided, regardless of partisanship, into three camps: those who claim his actions are illegal and ineffective; those who say they are legal but ineffective; and those who think the actions are both legal and beneficial to Americans. Some voices from the right claim that Trump's step into legislative territory is unconstitutional and ineffective, while others commend him for taking action to provide economic relief during the pandemic when congressional stimulus talks stalled. Many voices on the left claimed the actions are an illicit abuse of power. Others said the orders were not illegal, but merely band-aid solutions for a much broader economic problem.
TITLE=> New Hampshire Democratic Primary Set for Tuesday. ARTICLE=> New Hampshire will hold its 2020 presidential primary election Tuesday, the second of the 2020 election cycle following Iowa. In general, polls show Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with the lead; there are only twenty-four delegates at stake on Tuesday. Most reporting outlets focused on polls and their implications for the rest of the campaign. Some right-leaning sources focused on Biden's Iowa showing and projected New Hampshire underperformance.
TITLE=> May 2019 Jobs Report. ARTICLE=> The US economy added 75,000 jobs in May, a slowdown that some analysts see as the effects of a trade war. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.6%, a 50-year low.
TITLE=> Trump Replaces Campaign Manager Brad Parscale with Bill Stepien. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced on Facebook and later on Twitter that he would replace current campaign manager Brad Parscale with Bill Stepien, who had served as deputy campaign manager. Both Parscale and Stepien worked on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign; Parscale is expected to return to his role as digital strategies manager, which he held in 2016. Parscale's replacement comes after Trump fell 15 percentage points behind Biden, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday. Coverage from left-and center-rated outlets were more likely to highlight Trump's decreasing popularity in some polls. Some right-rated outlets framed the decision as being significant to Trump's 2020 campaign strategy.
TITLE=> Controversy Mounts Over Trump's Cancellation of Brennan's Security Clearance. ARTICLE=> A bipartisan group of more than 175 officials from the Pentagon and State Department added their names to a statement condemning President Trump's recent decision to revoke ex-CIA director John Brennan's security clearance for publicly criticizing the president's interactions with Russia.

TITLE=> Michael Cohen, Trump's Former Attorney, Sentenced to Three Years in Prison. ARTICLE=> President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for arranging secret payments to women who claimed to have affairs with Trump, neglecting to report millions of dollars in income, and lying to Congress about Trump's business dealings with Russia. Cohen told the judge that his loyalty to the president caused him to "choose darkness over light" and that he felt it was his responsibility to cover up Trump's "dirty deeds."
TITLE=> Perspectives: How Might Laws Solve Big Tech's Free Speech Dilemma?. ARTICLE=> The question of how major technology companies like Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gate-keep speech and information on their internet platforms is a divisive one, especially in the context of the First Amendment. People across the spectrum often disagree on what freedom of speech entails, and that debate has evolved into arguments about how free speech is encouraged or moderated online. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act currently protects internet companies from potential legal liabilities stemming from third-party content published on their platforms. Some of these companies have recently taken steps to flag and censor purported falsehoods regarding the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic, but have at times unjustly censored valid points in the process. 	Many left- and right-rated voices agree that new laws need to be passed to solve Big Tech's First Amendment issue — but they disagree starkly on what those laws would do. Right-rated voices have called for restrictions on what content tech companies can censor; some also say tech companies should have their Section 230 protections stripped if they choose to become arbiters of truth. Many left-rated voices have instead advocated government regulations requiring tech companies to eliminate misinformation and disinformation on their platforms by moderating content more closely and deplatforming offenders.
TITLE=> White House To Unveil Spending Cuts Package to Congress. ARTICLE=> The White House is preparing to send Congress a roughly $15 billion package of spending cuts today, with many of the reductions involving money that has been authorized but not spent.

TITLE=> Trump Says Man Shoved by Buffalo Police "Could Be" Connected to Antifa. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump advanced an unfounded theory Tuesday about the man who was hospitalized after being pushed to the ground by Buffalo police at a protest last week, tweeting that he "could be an ANTIFA provocateur". The man, 75-year-old Martin Gugino, is reportedly a longtime activist, and was discharged from the hospital Tuesday. Reports from throughout the political spectrum focused on the backlash to Trump's tweet, and the relative silence from Republican lawmakers who had been questioned on the matter. Some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on testimony from Gugino's friends that he is gentle and passive; some right-rated outlets reported that Gugino was arrested in 2012 at a White House protest and recently deleted his social media accounts.
TITLE=> Coronavirus Relief Package Backed by Trump's Approval, Bipartisan Support. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly spent most of Friday working out details of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a multi-billion dollar stimulus package in response to the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus. Media coverage focused on President Donald Trump's tweet in support of the deal, as well as the bipartisan agreement's apparent efficiency, which could push the bill through the Senate some time next week. Others concentrated on a separate tax cut Congress is reportedly considering to provide additional virus relief. The package includes free virus testing, unemployment benefits and paid emergency leave.
TITLE=> Dominion Voting Systems and the 2020 Election. ARTICLE=> Dominion Voting Systems, a electronic voting technology company used in 28 states, is at the center of ongoing 2020 presidential election fact-checking and debate. President Donald Trump has blamed the company for purportedly rigging the election against him; fact-checkers on all sides have discredited viral claims that Dominion switched millions of Trump votes to Biden votes. Left- and center-rated media outlets have focused their coverage of Dominion almost entirely on debunking purportedly false claims about the company and the election. The story received more attention overall from right-rated outlets. Some coverage from right-rated sources reported that many Dominion staffers had donated to Democratic candidates; other reports concentrated on concerns previously raised by Democratic lawmakers about the security of Dominion's technology.
TITLE=> House Republican Sues to Allow Pence to Overturn Election. ARTICLE=> A group of Republicans led by Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert sued Vice President Mike Pence on Monday to grant Pence “sole authority” to determine which Electoral College votes are counted. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of attempts by supporters of President Donald Trump to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. As part of their lawsuit, the Republican plaintiffs are also seeking to strike down the 1887 Electoral Count Act as unconstitutional. The House of Representatives will meet Jan. 6 to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win. Outlets from across the spectrum said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed. Some right-rated outlets framed the lawsuit as seeking to give Pence authority to determine the “legitimacy” of electoral votes. Some left-rated outlets mentioned that the judge hearing the case was appointed by Trump.
TITLE=> President Trump Imposes Tariffs on Solar Panels and Washing Machines. ARTICLE=> President Trump imposed high tariffs on solar panels and washing machines coming primarily from China and South Korea. Many on the Left claim that this is a major blow to renewable energy and the fight to stop climate change, while others say the move is part of Trump's "America First" agenda.

TITLE=> McCarthy Pulls All Five GOP Members From Jan. 6 Committee After Pelosi Rejects Two of His Appointees. ARTICLE=> House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five Republican members from the January 6 select committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of McCarthy's Republican appointees. Pelosi declined to accept Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana based on "statements and actions" made by the representatives, citing concern for "the integrity of the investigation." Both Jordan and Banks voted against certifying the 2020 election. McCarthy said Pelosi's decision was an "egregious abuse of power," and that unless Pelosi seats all five of his Republican nominees, "Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts." Rep. Liz Cheney, who was appointed by Pelosi, remains the only Republican on the committee as of Wednesday. The committee is expected to hold its first hearing next week. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Some on the right criticized Pelosi's decision as a partisan choice. Some on the left pointed out that the agreed-upon structure of the committee gave Pelosi power to veto McCarthy's selections. Editor's Note: The original headline incorrectly referred to the House select committee as a "commission." The commission was blocked by Senate Republicans.
TITLE=> Amid Criticism, Harvard Will Ask Education Dept. to Reallocate $8.6M Stimulus Aid. ARTICLE=> After criticism from President Donald Trump, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and others, Harvard University will ask the Department of Education to reallocate the $8.6 million it was slated to receive as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The university, which is the world's richest higher education institution, had previously said it would use the money to help students in financial need. Some sources focused on President Trump incorrectly insinuating that Harvard received the aid as part of the small business-oriented Paycheck Protection Program. Most left-rated outlets accentuated economic hardships for the education system amid the coronavirus pandemic; others, particularly right-rated sources, concentrated specifically on Harvard's $41 billion endowment and the similar wealth at other Ivy League schools, which were all slated to receive aid under CARES.
TITLE=> Kavanaugh Confirmed to Supreme Court. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, ending a very contentious battle and likely shifting the court to the right.
TITLE=> Donald Trump and Barack Obama Spar Over Who Gets Credit For A Strong Economy. ARTICLE=> Both Donald Trump and Barack Obama are taking credit for a robust economy.

TITLE=> Green New Deal Dies in Senate. ARTICLE=> The final vote was 57 against (including all Republicans and a handful of Democrats), and the remaining (43 Democrats) voting "present" in protest. No one voted in favor of the plan. At least 60 votes were needed to keep the bill crafted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) moving, meaning the legislation is dead. Republicans have criticized the plan as an unrealistic, radical socialist fantasy to remake the entire American economy, while some Congressional Democrats said the effort by Republicans to bring the plan to the floor was a political ploy or "sham" to divide Democrats.
TITLE=> Five Pence Aides Test Positive for COVID-19; Pence Tests Negative. ARTICLE=> At least five people in Vice President Mike Pence’s circle have tested positive for COVID-19, including chief of staff Marc Short and senior political advisor Marty Obst. Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence tested negative on Monday. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows refused to comment on the extent of the outbreak on Sunday, telling CNN that “Sharing personal information is not something that we should do.” Senate Democrats asked Pence not to preside over Monday's confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, citing coronavirus concerns. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to report on Senate Democrats’ request and not on the outbreak itself. Some coverage in left-rated outlets focused on comments by Mark Meadows saying, “We are not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigations.”
TITLE=> Seattle Police Chief Resigns After Department Cuts. ARTICLE=> Carmen Best, Seattle's first African American police chief, resigned on Monday evening after the city council voted to cut some funding to the police budget and eliminate jobs for 100 officers. Best will be retiring after 28 years on the force. Her retirement comes after police were told to stand down and allow protesters to occupy a six-block area of Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, as well as protest outside Best’s home. The council also decided to cut Best’s salary from $285,000 to $172,000.
TITLE=> Hurricane Irma Hurtles Toward Florida. ARTICLE=> Weather forecasts and warnings have grown increasingly grim as the state of Florida prepares for Hurricane Irma to hit.

TITLE=> Israeli Ground Forces Attack Gaza Strip. ARTICLE=> Israel's ground military forces attacked the Gaza Strip on Thursday, escalating the conflict in the region after Palestinian and Israeli forces exchanged rockets and airstrikes for several days. The Israel Defense Force (IDF) tweeted Thursday that "IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip." Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously announced that IDF soldiers were gathering at the nation’s border in preparation for invasion. While the extent of the Israeli assault was not clear, the IDF later clarified that while ground forces were newly involved in the fighting, Israeli troops were still firing from within Israel. The violence comes after weeks of escalating tensions over planned evictions of Palestinians from a Jerusalem neighborhood and Israeli police raids on the Al-Aqsa mosque during Ramadan.  Israel's ground force movement received coverage from across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Supreme Court and Bipartisanship. ARTICLE=> Despite increasing political polarization in the U.S., the Supreme Court has delivered several recent unanimous or near-majority rulings on high profile cases. June 17 saw both a unanimous ruling by the Court on Fulton v. Philadelphia, and a 7-2 ruling to uphold the Affordable Care Act. This month, a Pennsylvania cheerleader's free speech case and a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) federal antitrust case also saw unanimous or near-unanimous rulings from the Justices. This comes as some argue that the Supreme Court has become partisan and "unbalanced." President Joe Biden, who called the U.S. court system "out of whack" during his presidential campaign, created a commission in April to investigate adding seats to the Supreme Court.  Some on social media expressed their surprise at a "rare" unanimous Supreme Court ruling, while some outlets pointed out that the percentage of all unanimous Supreme Court ranged from 36% to 66% between 2008 and 2019. Some voices on the right claimed that the "divided" Supreme Court narrative was being pushed by Democratic lawmakers as an excuse to change the structure of the Supreme Court and gain political power. Others commended the justices for "properly practicing politics" by reaching "broad agreement on narrow issues" and avoiding blatant partisanship. 
TITLE=> Preview of Monday Night's Iowa Caucuses. ARTICLE=> Democratic candidates and their chief backers have begun to set expectations ahead of Monday night's Iowa presidential caucuses.

TITLE=> Seven Capitol Police Officers Sue Trump, Supporters Over Jan. 6 Riot. ARTICLE=> Seven Capitol Police officers filed a lawsuit Thursday alleging that former President Donald Trump, some of his supporters and right-wing extremist group leaders planed to interfere with the transition of power following the 2020 election, which purportedly led to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. The suit accuses Trump and others, including former adviser Roger Stone and the leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, of violating the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. The act includes protections of an individual's constitutional rights, and outlaws conspiracies that disrupt Congress’s constitutional duties. The lawsuit alleges that Trump and his supporters attempted to use false voter fraud claims to overturn election results in regions with large black populations; five of the seven officers on the lawsuit are black. Trump had no immediate comment on the suit but has criticized efforts to investigate his connection to the riot for purportedly violating executive privilege. The news was covered prominently by left- and center-rated news outlets Thursday; Newsmax (Lean Right bias) was one of the few right-rated outlets to publish original reporting on the news as of Thursday afternoon. Some left-rated outlets described the riot as an "insurrection" in their headlines; Newsmax's headline instead used the term "events." Many sources, regardless of bias, describe the events of Jan. 6 as a violent riot in their coverage.
TITLE=> Virus Cases Surge in Some States, Forcing Reversals. ARTICLE=> As the number of new COVID-19 coronavirus cases hits all-time daily highs in the U.S., some hard-hit states have rolled back reopening plans, including Texas, Arizona, and Florida. Texas postponed all elective surgeries in order to accommodate the potential influx of new, severely ill patients. Coverage from left-rated sources often brought up that states with soaring virus cases were some of the first to lift restrictions, and will now likely have to revert back to earlier lockdown measures. Some coverage from right-rated sources attributed the rise in cases to increased testing, with some mentioning that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) will not delay already approved reopening plans. This differs from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) decision to re-close bars and reverse other reopening measures as cases surge.
TITLE=> Government Shutdown Avoided. ARTICLE=> Negotiators in the U.S. Congress reached a deal late on Sunday on around $1 trillion in federal funding that would avert a government shutdown later this week, while handing President Donald Trump a down payment on his promised military buildup.

The White House issued a statement saying that Shaub was more interested in "grandstanding and lobbying" than advising the executive branch on ethics.

TITLE=> If Democrats Flip the House, What Will They Prioritize?. ARTICLE=> With Democrats largely projected to flip the House, perspectives vary on their potential agenda, with some positing they will reform campaign ethics, outlaw gerrymandering, and bolster voting rights, while others say they will prioritize impeachment and increase spending. Republicans are expected to keep the Senate, so some also point out that many policy initiatives on both sides of the aisle will likely come to a standstill.
TITLE=> House Ways And Means Committee Seeks Trump Tax Returns. ARTICLE=> The House Ways and Means Committee has requested that the IRS turn over the last six years of tax returns from President Trump.
TITLE=> State Department Finds Violations But No "Systemic" Mishandling in Clinton Email Probe. ARTICLE=> A State Department investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of private email found  "no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information," though it did cite 38 people who had committed violations. The department's report, released this week after a multiyear probe, reviewed approximately 30,000 emails and concluded that while there were “instances of classified information being inappropriately” transmitted, many of the individuals involved “were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them.” Coverage of the news was split, with many right-leaning outlets focusing on the violations and the obstacles that investigators faced in reviewing the emails, more than 30,000 of which had been famously deleted. Left-leaning outlets, in contrast, tended to highlight the report's conclusion that no incriminating evidence had been uncovered.
TITLE=> Trump Tweets 'I Won the Election' After Tweeting Biden 'Won'. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump seemed to acknowledge projected 2020 election winner Joe Biden’s victory on Sunday, writing “He won because the election was rigged” on a retweeted video clip of Fox News’ Jesse Waters. Soon afterwards, Trump affirmed his commitment to not conceding the election, tweeting, “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!” Trump reaffirmed his position Sunday night, tweeting “I WON THE ELECTION.” Twitter flagged each of Trump’s tweets, saying “This claim about election fraud is disputed” and “Official sources called this election differently.” Coverage in some center- and left-rated outlets called Trump’s claims “baseless,” “debunked” and “false.” Coverage in some right-rated outlets addressed Trump’s claims indirectly by pointing to election lawsuits and bipartisan statements that the election “went smoothly.”
TITLE=> President Trump Continues Coronavirus Fight at White House. ARTICLE=> President Trump continues treatment for the coronavirus after returning to the White House Monday evening. Trump tweeted in part, "Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life" Monday afternoon before leaving the hospital.

TITLE=> Biden Signs Bill Extending Government Spending Hours Before Deadline. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden signed a short-term stopgap bill on Thursday to extend government spending through Dec. 3, hours ahead of a potential government shutdown.

Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with some left-rated outlets focusing on angles like “U.S. lags behind Russia and China in sending COVID-19 vaccines” and “but activists say much more is needed.”
TITLE=> Biden Administration's Latest Vaccine Push Includes 'Door-to-Door' Outreach, Focus on Doctor's Offices, Workplaces.

The administration's strategy includes "door-to-door" community outreach, vaccinating students ages 12-18 before school opens this fall, and increasing vaccine availability in doctor’s offices and workplaces. This comes after the U.S. failed to meet the Biden's goal of 70% of U.S. adults vaccinated by July 4; According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, just under half of the U.S. population is expected to be fully vaccinated by the end of the week. All vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are reportedly effective against the Delta variant.  Biden's speech Tuesday received wide coverage from across the spectrum.

He echoed this message in his first address as president Wednesday, calling on Americans to face the challenges ahead together, to "show a little tolerance and humility," and to "end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal." Biden also said that the country's unity is threatened by several forces including racism, political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism. Some on all sides, but predominantly from the left and center, praised Biden's emphasis on unity as an urgent and necessary goal; others, such as Al Jazeera, paint it as a daunting task. Some voices from the left also criticized GOP anger at Biden's speech, painting it as an attempt to dodge blame and take control of the narrative. Biden received some criticism, especially from the right, for these aspects of his speech, saying that unity came across as conditional, and as a call to conform to a political correctness that discourages free speech. Some prominent right voices such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, criticized this aspect of Biden's speech, saying that the Biden administration would likely paint a "broad definition of white supremacy," allowing him to "exclude some Americans." Overall, pessimistic or negative takes around Biden's message seemed to be highlighted more than positive ones throughout the online media spectrum. Some voices from both left and right were more receptive to Biden's message and focused on the actions of the new administration, examining his latest legislative proposals to see if they serve the interest of both parties.

Her remarks come after a report by The Hill revealed some lawmakers are sleeping in their offices and waking up in the halls of the capital building in their underwear. Critics have said her viewpoint conflicts with her 'socialist' views. AOC said  a $4,500 pay raise on a $174,000 salary is "not even like a raise." She recognized, on Twitter, that her stance on the issue is not a popular one for any side of the aisle.

TITLE=> Top FDA and WHO Scientists Call COVID-19 Booster Shots Unnecessary For Most Americans At This Time. ARTICLE=> An international group of scientists published a paper Monday that suggests more scientific evidence is needed to justify giving booster shots to most Americans at this time. Co-authors included Marion Gruber and Phil Krause, two senior FDA officials who are leaving the organization later this fall over frustrations with the Biden administration’s "premature" booster plan, along with several scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO). The report concludes that vaccine "efficacy against severe disease remains high" except for individuals with compromised immune systems, and highlights how "the unvaccinated are still the major drivers of transmission" during this stage of the pandemic. WHO scientists argued that the U.S. should prioritize giving doses to countries with low vaccination rates to reduce the risk of serious illness and emerging variants. The paper also emphasized the importance of creating "clear public health messaging before boosting" to mitigate vaccine hesitancy. While the CDC and FDA advised the White House to slow down its vaccine booster plan earlier this month, the Biden administration has yet to delay its plans to begin widely offering the third shots on Sept. 20. The FDA will meet with an outside panel of experts on Sept. 17 to further review the Pfizer/BioNTech booster shot. The Biden administration's booster shot plan continues to divide voices across the spectrum. Left-rated outlets were more likely to suggest that the evidence is "evolving," noting the similar strategy used to distribute annual flu shots.

On Wednesday, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs sharply criticized the recount, including for reports that ballots and laptops had been left unattended. The same day, a Justice Department official warned that the audit could be violating the 1960 Civil Rights Act by giving election materials to Florida-based contractor CyberNinjas; Arizona Republicans said they opposed federal intervention. Former President Donald Trump voiced support for the audit on April 27, saying that Democrats "know exactly what they’ve done."

Coverage in some right-rated outlets focused on Maricopa County’s refusal to cooperate with a subpoena for routers.

On Friday, the chief executive of drug company Pfizer said the company would not apply for regulatory clearance for its vaccine until the third week of November at the earliest.

Right-rated outlets tended to focus more on the details of the pharmacy partnership plan and analyzing where vaccine developments currently stand.
TITLE=> Federal Judge Blocks Enforcement of Texas Heartbeat Act. ARTICLE=> A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked enforcement of Texas' heartbeat abortion law. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helped provide an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; citizens are awarded at least $10,000 if the suit is successful.  Part of the legal debate over the law has focused on this provision, which removes the responsibility of enforcement from the state's executive branch and places it in the hands of citizens. The action comes after the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect in a 5-4 vote on Sept. 1. Legal action will continue as the decision in Texas will be appealed to the conservative Firth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas.

The Senate bill is expected to keep the House-passed $400 per week unemployment payments, which would continue through August. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates the change would cut an estimated 17 million people from eligibility, though 280 million people would still get a check. Moderate Democrats pushed for reduced unemployment; GOP lawmakers argue the bill is too large and full of allocations unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some moderate Democrats, such as Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Veronica Escobar, criticized Democratic leadership, saying the party's moderate wing isn't interested in passing the left’s agenda items without trying to gather bipartisan support. The deal received coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Some coverage from the right highlighted moderate Democrats' criticism of Democratic leadership.

Coverage from some right-rated outlets has framed Cotton's response as a clarification and painted his initial comments as less deserving of scrutiny. Left-rated outlets were more likely to frame his response as "playing defense" or "denial."

TITLE=> White House Looks for ‘Legal Authority’ to Renew Eviction Ban After Congressional Extension Fails. ARTICLE=> The CDC “has been unable to find legal authority” to renew the national eviction moratorium that expired on July 31, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, adding that the White House was “redoubling efforts to identify all available legal authorities to provide necessary protections.” The statement came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on the Biden administration to renew and extend the eviction ban until October 18. President Joe Biden asked lawmakers to extend the ban via legislation on Thursday, but House Democrats failed to gather enough support from moderates and Republicans by Friday. In a June 29 concurring opinion to a Supreme Court decision upholding the ban, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that Congress had the authority to extend the eviction ban beyond July. In lieu of a congressional extension, Biden asked landlords and local governments to hold off on evictions while the administration searched for a legal way to extend the ban.  Coverage across the spectrum pointed out that “millions of renters” could face eviction as a result of the eviction ban ending. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to focus on renters themselves. Coverage in right-rated outlets was more likely to focus on Progressives’ criticisms of Democratic leaders. 
TITLE=> Trump Gets Jeers and Cheers at UFC Event in NYC. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump was greeted with mixed reactions by a crowd in New York City on Friday night, when he attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship 244 event at Madison Square Garden. Videos show some audience members booing the Republican as he enters the arena, while others cheered. The news was like a Rorschach test for media outlets, with right-leaning publications highlighting the positive response from the crowd and left-leaning outlets underscoring the negative reception. Many publications on both sides noted the timing and location of the event, which comes just days after the lifelong New Yorker announced he had changed his residency to Florida. It's also the second time in less than a week that Trump has been publicly booed at a sporting event.
TITLE=> Trump to Push for Tax Reform. ARTICLE=> President Trump is reportedly meeting with senators this week to make a final push to get the tax bill through, with a vote coming as early as this Thursday. Republicans can only afford to lose two votes in order to pass the legislation.
TITLE=> House GOP Votes to Oust Liz Cheney From Leadership Post. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday morning, House Republicans voted to oust GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney from her leadership post, punishing the conservative Wyoming Republican for her outspoken opposition to former President Donald Trump. Since the decision was made by voice vote, there was no tally of how the lawmakers voted, yet sources inside the closed-door session said it was an overwhelming vote against her. This marks the first time in recent memory that a congressional GOP leader was toppled by rank-and-file Republicans in the middle of their term through a formal vote. Many see it as a sign of former President Donald Trump's influence on the GOP.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Begins. ARTICLE=> Hamas stopped firing rockets at Israel and Israel stopped bombing Gaza at 2 a.m. Friday following an unconditional ceasefire deal mediated by Egypt. After Israel’s Security Cabinet voted unanimously to accept the deal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office issued a statement pointing to Israel’s “unprecedented” and “significant achievements” during the conflict. Hamas also claimed the ceasefire as a victory, with Hamas supporters shouting "victory" as Palestinians took to the streets to celebrate. However, fears of continued violence rose after Israeli police once again clashed with Palestinians at the Al-Aqsa mosque on Friday; several Israeli officers reportedly hit journalists with batons during the incident, calling them “liars.” Voices from right-rated outlets tended to be more critical of Hamas and progressive Democrats in the United States. Voices in left-rated outlets tended to focus on the disproportionate Palestinian civilian casualties and call for long-term solutions.
TITLE=> Analysis of Senate Healthcare Bill. ARTICLE=> After a full day of being able to study the healthcare bill, more information is being revealed about what it says.
TITLE=> More on the Leaked NSA Report. ARTICLE=> The leak of top secret NSA report about an election cyberattack by Russia may have led to the ouster of its own leaker, and it seemed to show that while our election system as a whole may be safe, its parts are not. The report also contracts what President Obama said about Russian involvement in the election.
TITLE=> Zuckerberg Defends Facebook's Political Ads Policy. ARTICLE=> Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubled down on the company's decision to forgo fact-checking political ads on the platform this week, arguing that "people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying." Speaking at Georgetown University, the billionaire executive called digital speech the new "fifth estate" and said the move -- which reverses a previous policy banning political ads containing “false or misleading content"  -- would help protect it. He did not take questions from reporters. The comments triggered a new wave of debate about the tech giant's responsibility in regulating information on the platform. Democrats and civil rights groups have condemned the policy, claiming that it gives candidates a pass to lie and spread misinformation. Some conservatives, meanwhile, have applauded it for upholding free speech.
TITLE=> Justice Department Releases Carter Page FISA Documents. ARTICLE=> The Department of Justice on Saturday released a previously top-secret, heavily redacted set of documents related to the wiretapping of Carter Page in 2016. Page was a Trump campaign adviser at that time, and his surveillance has since become a controversial topic, with both the Democratic and Republican Intelligence Committee memos being released earlier this year. President Trump has reacted on Twitter, saying the documents "confirm with little doubt that the Department of 'Justice' and FBI misled the courts."

ARTICLE=> Officials in Haiti raised the death toll to 1,941 on Tuesday after Tropical Storm Grace hit the island nation while it recovered from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that leveled thousands of buildings on Saturday. About 1.2 million people were affected by the quake, including 540,000 children, a UNICEF statement said. The disaster has inspired comparisons to Haiti’s 2010 7.0-magnitude earthquake, which shined a light on the heavy presence of foreign aid organizations in the country.  Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely than right-rated outlets to prominently feature coverage of Haiti on online homepages on Tuesday. Some left- and center-rated outlets published articles on “how you can help” Haiti. 
TITLE=> Supreme Court Strikes Down Louisiana Abortion Restrictions. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Louisiana law regulating abortion clinics, reasserting a commitment to abortion rights.

Cipollone, rebukes the president's language on the Ukraine issue and overall, saying that Trump's conduct "fall[s] well beneath the dignity of the office."

TITLE=> Biden Administration to Prepare Infrastructure Package Up to $3 Trillion. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration's economic advisers are preparing an economic package that could cost up to $4 trillion, according to a New York Times report. The package, which President Joe Biden promised in his presidential campaign, aims to boost the economy, reduce economic inequality, enact climate change initiatives and provide free community college, universal preschool and a national paid leave program. The package would also include a sweeping infrastructure plan that would likely be financed by tax increases on businesses and wealthy individuals. Biden’s advisers are expected to present the proposal to the president and congressional leaders this week. Some reported that a $3 trillion effort was expected to be broken into two parts: one focused on infrastructure, and the other devoted to other domestic priorities such as schools. White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted Monday that Biden would not unveil a proposal this week, but that Biden "is considering a range of options" and added that "speculation is premature." Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to focus on the areas the package would address, specifically highlighting climate change and renewable energy initiatives. Coverage from the right framed the items addressed in the package as "Democratic priorities" and tended to raise concerns about the growing amount of national debt the bill would incur.
TITLE=> Fact-Checking the Trump and Biden Town Hall Events. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and Joe Biden held simultaneous town halls on separate networks Thursday night. Both candidates made at least some false or misleading statements. Some on the left and center praised NBC's Savannah Guthrie for her pointed questioning of Trump during the event; some on the right criticized ABC's George Stephanopoulos for not asking Biden about the New York Post's controversial story published earlier this week on his alleged corrupt foreign business dealings with Ukraine. More fact checks of the town halls were published in left-rated outlets than in center- and right-rated outlets. Some fact checks in left-rated outlets said that Trump made significantly more false statements than Biden. Fact checks in center- and right-rated outlets tended to focus on a specific candidate or a specific claim.
TITLE=> FBI Director Wray Testifies Before Congress. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Homeland Security Committee that, among other things, Russia was interfering in the 2020 election to hurt Joe Biden and that Antifa was “a real thing.” On Russia, Wray said: “Russia continues to try to influence our elections...primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as an anti-Russia establishment.” On Antifa, Wray said: “Antifa is a real thing. It's not a group or an organization. It's a movement, or an ideology may be one way of thinking of it.” Coverage in left-rated outlets focused primarily on Wray’s comments about Russia and framed them as contradicting President Donald Trump. Coverage in right-rated outlets focused primarily on Wray’s comments about Antifa and framed them as contradicting Democrat politicians.

TITLE=> Biden Sweeps South on Super Tuesday, Revives Campaign in Momentous Showing. ARTICLE=> Former Vice President Joe Biden put on a dominant performance on Super Tuesday 2020, winning 10 of 14 states and apparently cementing the race for the Democratic nomination as a two-way contest between he and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). While Sanders is projected to win California, Biden proved popular among southern voters and saw somewhat surprising success in Massachusetts and the Midwest. Media outlets and voices throughout the spectrum framed the night's results as massive for Biden's campaign, and focused coverage on the apparently deepening split between moderate Democrats supporting Biden and progressive Democrats backing Sanders. Six more primaries are scheduled for Tuesday, March 10 in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state.
TITLE=> Two Jail Guards Indicted in Connection with Jeffrey Epstein's Death. ARTICLE=> Two federal corrections officers were charged Tuesday with conspiracy and falsifying records in connection to Jeffrey Epstein's death. The officers, who were allegedly working feet from Epstein's cell when he died yet did not conduct routine prisoner checks, rejected a plea deal last week.

Mario Diaz-Balart, a ninth-term Florida Republican, and Rep. Ben McAdams, a freshman Democrat from Utah, revealed they had tested positive last week.
TITLE=> Several States Unveil Plans to Start Reopening in Next 2 Weeks. ARTICLE=> Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Ohio and Texas are some of the several states that have described definite plans to allow certain businesses and other aspects of society to reopen in the next two weeks. Debate continues about how to balance the needs for public health during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and the need for economic stimulus, with protests of lockdown measures and business closures happening in certain states over the past week. Some outlets focused on the fact that many of the states on the verge of ending lockdown measures are run by Republican governors; some right-rated outlets concentrated on the Justice Department's expressed intention to intervene if it deems a certain state's lockdown measures are too overbearing. Others relied on statistical evidence to make a case for why states should or shouldn't open at this point.

TITLE=> Scientists Craft Herd Immunity Plan to Reopen Society; Others Say It's Too Risky. ARTICLE=> A proposal from Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard, Dr. Sunetra Gupta of Oxford, and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford — titled the Great Barrington Declaration — seeks to end COVID-19 coronavirus lockdowns and reopen society. The plan focuses on "herd immunity," in which people would purportedly build immunity to the coronavirus without a vaccine; the authors argue lockdowns "are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health." Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public health experts have dismissed the idea; when asked about the plan at his NBC town hall Thursday, President Donald Trump said in part, "the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself." Coverage from many left- and center-rated sources framed the plan as a misguided and dangerous proposal to pursue herd immunity, one that could potentially cost thousands of lives. Coverage from right-rated outlets, primarily libertarian ones, painted the plan as a vague but well-intentioned effort to allow healthy people to get back to a sense of normalcy while protecting the most at-risk individuals from the virus.
TITLE=> Senate Parliamentarian Rules Minimum Wage Increase Ineligible for Budget Reconciliation. ARTICLE=> Democrats cannot use budget reconciliation to pass a $15 minimum wage as part of their $1.9 trillion stimulus package, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled Thursday. Without budget reconciliation, efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 would be unlikely to reach the 60-vote threshold required to overcome a Republican filibuster. While the move drew criticism from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ilhan Omar, the White House reportedly does not plan to challenge the ruling. Despite this, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday evening that she would still try to pass the full stimulus package in the House, including the $15 minimum wage. Coverage from across the spectrum followed similar narratives and included brief analysis of various political figures’ responses to the ruling.
TITLE=> Senate Prepares Bill to Avert Shutdown Before Thursday Deadline. ARTICLE=> Senators from both parties worked Wednesday to come to an agreement on a bill to fund the government through Dec. 3, days after Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have both averted a government shutdown and suspended the debt ceiling. Senate Republicans said that while they opposed Democrats’ funding and debt ceiling bill, they would support a standalone funding bill. With no other avenues to fund the government before Thursday’s deadline, Democrats were forced to omit the debt ceiling from the new temporary funding bill. Democrats were divided on Wednesday on how to suspend the debt ceiling, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned several times was necessary to avert a U.S. default in mid-October.  Coverage was more prominent in D.C.-focused outlets. Left-rated outlets tended to feature coverage critical of Senate Republicans' debt ceiling vote. Right-rated outlets tended to feature coverage criticizing Democrats' spending plans. Coverage across the spectrum focused heavily on Congress on Wednesday, including the Senate's stopgap budget bill, the debt ceiling, and the negotiations surrounding Democrats' two major spending bills.

Others reported on the history of the holiday, and how the pandemic and heightened health concerns are changing how people use and consume cannabis.
TITLE=> Voters Recall California Judge Who Presided Over Brock Turner Rape Case. ARTICLE=> Residents of Santa Clara, California voted to recall Judge Aaron Persky, who controversially sentenced Stanford student Brock Turner to six months in prison after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. While some celebrated the decision, many on both sides of the aisle have argued that it is a setback for criminal justice, as it will encourage judges to impose harsher sentences on all defendants for fear of public backlash.

This comes after criticism of college admissions for not having enough diversity on campuses. The score is an index on a scale of 1 to 100. 50 represents average privilege; anything above 50 represents an amount of adversity while anything below represents a degree of privilege.
TITLE=> Trump Says He Will Intervene in Texas Election Lawsuit.

TITLE=> June Jobs Report Falls Short of Expectations. ARTICLE=> The rate of job growth in June failed to meet expectations, according to multiple sources. The number of jobs expected in June varied between media sources, but all concur that roughly 102,000 jobs were added. This fell short of Wall Street's 135,000 jobs expected. Most sources also agreed that slower job growth numbers may lead to the Federal Reserve taking action by cutting interest rates at the end of July. It should be noted that as of Wednesday afternoon, very few left-leaning sources and few right-leaning sources have covered the matter — most of the news coverage came from outlets with a center rating.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Moderna and Pfizer Announce Progress on COVID-19 Vaccines. ARTICLE=> Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer have both announced COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines that are reportedly about 95% effective.

The nine people, all members of the LeBaron family, were dual-citizens of the United States and Mexico and practicing Mormons, and were reportedly en route to a wedding. According to several reports, there are multiple survivors; the attack is reportedly the work of one of Mexico's prominent drug cartels. President Trump suggested the U.S. military should go to Mexico to combat the cartels, an offer that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador refused. It is widely suspected, though unconfirmed, that the attack was a case of mistaken identity.

TITLE=> Jeff Bezos' Phone Reportedly Hacked by Saudi Arabia. ARTICLE=> According to reporting from The Guardian, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos' phone was hacked in May 2018 by Saudi Arabia.

TITLE=> Trump Signs New Trade Pact With Mexico, Canada.

TITLE=> Gaetz Reportedly Asked Trump White House for Blanket Pardon. ARTICLE=> Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida) privately asked the Trump administration for blanket preemptive pardons for himself and congressional allies, sources for multiple outlets said. Gaetz, an ardent Trump ally, was under investigation by the Department of Justice for sex trafficking at the time; it is unknown whether Trump or Gaetz knew about the investigation then. Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday that “Gaetz never asked me for a pardon.” Sources told ABC News that while Trump was aware of Gaetz’s request, the White House quickly dismissed it. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing, alleging that the ongoing investigation was part of an extortion attempt. The New York Times first broke this story. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to place greater emphasis on Trump’s statement denying that Gaetz asked him for a pardon. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to quote sources and focused on Gaetz’s reported pardon request.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Ron DeSantis Criticizes '60 Minutes' For Report. ARTICLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called CBS News journalists "smear merchants" who spread a "horse manure" narrative after CBS aired a 60 Minutes report that criticized DeSantis's vaccine rollout and alleged he funneled vaccines to rich communities while using a privatized system that benefited political donors. "These are smear merchants. That's why nobody trusts corporate media. They are a disaster in what they are doing," DeSantis said in a press conference Tuesday. The 60 Minutes segment claimed that DeSantis made a deal to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to the grocery store chain Publix after the company made a $100,000 donation to DeSantis' committee. The segment suggested there was a possible link between the donation and the state's partnership with Publix stores for vaccine distribution; however, no other evidence beyond speculation was provided in the 60 Minutes segment. On Monday, DeSantis' office said, "Florida partnered with Publix because they were ready to administer the vaccine in their pharmacies in a matter of days, whereas other pharmacies were not ready." Outlets on all sides of the spectrum criticized 60 Minutes. Some voices from the right heavily criticized CBS and 60 Minutes, calling them "biased" and "disgraced," while some on the left said 60 Minutes' mistake would give DeSantis the boost he needed for his reelection campaign in Florida, and even a potential Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
TITLE=> Congress Meets to Confirm Electoral College Results. ARTICLE=> As Congress meets to confirm President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election, a group of Republicans in Congress plans to object to certain states’ Electoral College votes. Political analysts from across the spectrum say the objections are highly unlikely to alter the election result, and high-ranking Republicans have voiced opposition to the move. Additionally, thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of decisive election fraud have gathered in Washington, D.C. for the Save America Rally, leading to some clashes with police Tuesday night. Trump spoke at the rally on Wednesday, saying, “Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore...We will stop the steal.”  Outlets on all sides provided live coverage, analysis and opinion on the much-anticipated congressional confirmation. Left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight voices opposing Republicans’ election challenges. Right-rated outlets featured some pro-objection voices and generally kept their editorial focus primarily on Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia, with some exceptions.
TITLE=> Report: Facebook Paid Political Consulting Group to Discredit Critics. ARTICLE=> A new report by the New York Times alleges that Facebook sought to "delay, deny and deflect" amid the criticism it received for its handling of Russian disinformation and hate speech.

Some analyzed how the country's changing racial and ethnic makeup will impact politics, and how the census data in general will influence redistricting.

ARTICLE=> A Texas abortion law that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected took effect Wednesday after the Supreme Court decided not to act on an emergency petition filed by abortion providers to stop the measure. The Heartbeat Act (SB 8) bans abortions around the six-week mark, and allows individuals to sue anyone suspected of helping a woman get an abortion. The law allows for a exemption for "medical emergencies," but does not provide an exception for rape or incest.  It is one of most restrictive abortion bans in the United States. Critics argue that many women don't yet know they're pregnant at the six-week mark; Texas state Sen. and sponsor of the bill Bryan Hughes (R) called it “the most powerful pro-life legislation in Texas history.”

TITLE=> Trump's Push of MSNBC Host Conspiracy Theory Met by Calls for Censorship. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's tweets promoting a conspiracy theory about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough have prompted calls for Twitter to step in and potentially censor his account. As part of an ongoing feud with Scarborough, Trump has suggested an unproven theory that the "Morning Joe" host was involved in the 2001 death of 28-year-old intern Lori Klausutis, who worked for Scarborough when he was a Florida congressman. Klausutis's widower and Scarborough's co-host and wife Mika Brezenski have asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to delete the tweets, citing the pain of the memory and accusing the president of exploiting the death for political gain. Some left-rated voices backed the calls for censoring Trump's tweets.

TITLE=> FBI Will Investigate Threats Against, Harassment of School Board Members. ARTICLE=> In a press release Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland addressed "a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school board members, teachers and workers in our nation’s public schools." The release said Garland directed the FBI and U.S. attorneys to work with state and local leaders to "open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment and response by law enforcement." The Justice Department (DOJ) is also expected to create a task force "to determine how federal enforcement tools can be used to prosecute these crimes." The National School Boards Association (NSBA) wrote a letter to President Joe Biden last month calling on the federal government to address "the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation" against school faculty over mask mandates and critical race theory (CRT) in schools.  	The DOJ's announcement was covered across the spectrum, especially by right-rated outlets, many of which featured the story prominently in their coverage Tuesday. Many right-rated voices criticized the announcement and accused the Biden administration of trying to suppress debate about mask mandates and CRT in schools; some reports from the right highlighted pushback on the press release from Republican lawmakers.

TITLE=> Senate Approves $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Bill. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package early Saturday morning, after a 27-hour marathon overnight session. Senators voted 50-49, with every Republican voting against the bill, and with one Republican absent. The package kept $1,400 in direct payments for Americans under a certain income threshold and $350 billion to help state and local governments reopen, but scaled back unemployment benefits to $300 a week until early September, and cut a federal $15 minimum wage proposal amid pressure from moderate Democrats. On Saturday morning, President Joe Biden told reporters the package was "one more giant step forward" on delivering on his promise for more pandemic relief. Republican lawmakers heavily criticized the bill; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said "the Senate has never spent $2 trillion in a more haphazard way or through a less rigorous process." The legislation will be sent to the House for approval before it reaches Biden's desk.⁣⁣The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Left-rated outlets tended to provide analysis of various items on the bill. Coverage from some center- and right-rated outlets highlighted the tension between moderate and progressive Democrats, as well as the criticism the bill received from Republican lawmakers.⁣ 3/6/21: This story has been updated for clarity on stimulus payment caps at 2:30 pm PST

Supporters of today's decision argue that the move is necessary to protect consumers from paying higher rates for slower service, as well as to safeguard the public from fake news.

TITLE=> CDC's Updated COVID-19 Numbers Misinterpreted. ARTICLE=> A weekly update from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)reported that 94 percent of Americans who died from the COVID-19 coronavirus also had other “types of health conditions and contributing causes," while only 6 percent of COVID-19 related deaths cited the virus as the only cause of death. Some of the other health conditions include influenza and pneumonia, respiratory failure and respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest and heart failure; the CDC said the information is based on death certificates. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump retweeted a post by an alleged QAnon supporter suggesting that the CDC "quietly updated" the site and that it had previously inflated the death toll. The post was widely shared, but has since been deleted on Twitter for allegedly spreading misinformation. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets focused on combating misinterpretations of the CDC data and framed the story as a concern that misinformation could be weaponized to spur distrust in media and in public health officials. Some left-rated outlets and fact checkers focused specifically on the president retweeting a misleading interpretation of the data, which was subsequently censored by Twitter. Coverage from the right tended to frame the new data as evidence that the virus' effects have purportedly been exaggerated.

TITLE=> Stage Set for Decisive Senate Races in Georgia. ARTICLE=> Georgia voters will cast their ballots in two special U.S. Senate elections on Jan. 5 that will decide which political party controls the 50-member Congressional body. Incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are facing challenges from Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff; none of the four candidates gained 50% of the vote in the initial election, so state law requires that a "runoff" election — essentially a rematch — be held. With all other Senate races effectively decided, Republicans currently hold 50 seats to Democrats' 48. Wins for Warnock and Ossoff would create a straight 50-50 tie in the Senate, which would make the vice president the tie-breaking vote. Coverage on all sides has speculated about possible campaign and fundraising tactics to be used between now and January. Many reports focused on the Democrat candidates' calls for more debates, and the incumbents' apparent reluctance to the idea; some coverage also analyzed potential donors and fundraising sources for both parties.

Biden told reporters Monday that while he believes peaceful protest is understandable, "there is absolutely no justification" for violence and looting. He added, "we should listen to Daunte's mom who is calling for peace and calm." Biden then said that whether it was an accident or on purpose "remains to be determined by a full-blown investigation." Police responded to protests Sunday with riot gear and tear gas and chemical agents as protestors gathered in Brooklyn Center and threw projectiles. About 20 business in the area were broken into, while some of them were looted; 500 National Guard troops were deployed to Minneapolis on Monday.

Therefore, that’s what I’ll do,” Cuomo said Tuesday, maintaining his stance that his behavior did not amount to sexual harassment. Cuomo will be replaced by Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who will become New York’s first female governor. Coverage was prominent and mostly balanced across the spectrum.

Outlets on both sides of the aisle focused on the governor's comments as well as those made by President Donald Trump, who called the attack "horrific" in a tweet on Sunday.

After her initial tweet, Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.) and other Jewish House Democrats issued a statement urging Omar to clarify her statements, to which Omar replied that her colleagues' "Islamophobic tropes," "harrassment" and "silencing" were "offensive" and "unbearable." On Thursday morning, however, Omar stated her comments were directed toward ongoing International Criminal Court probes, and that she "was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems." On Thursday, Pelosi and her team stated that while "legitimate criticism" of U.S. policies is protected by free speech, "drawing false equivalencies between democracies like the U.S. and Israel and groups that engage in terrorism like Hamas and the Taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress toward a future of peace and security for all." The statement also said that the team "welcome the clarification" from Omar that there is no moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel and Hamas and the Taliban.  Omar's comments, as well as the backlash from Democratic lawmakers, received coverage from across the spectrum; the story was covered more frequently by right-rated outlets.

TITLE=> Gallagher Found Not Guilty on All Counts Except One. ARTICLE=> Navy Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher has been found not guilty on multiple counts, including premeditated murder, related to the death of a captive Islamic State soldier in Iraq in 2017. Gallagher was found guilty of taking unofficial pictures with the corpse of the dead ISIS soldier. Gallagher's attorneys suggest that his arraignment and legal process has been part of a larger scheme by his subordinates to mutiny. Military juries, unlike civilian juries, need only a two-thirds majority to reach any decision; meaning that only five out of the seven jurors needed to concur to make a decision. Voices on both the left and right sides of the media referenced the fact that key prosecution witness Corey Scott — a Navy SEAL medic — changed his story during the course of the trial. The maximum penalty for one offense of posing for unofficial pictures with a dead body is four months imprisonment. During the trial, it was revealed that members of Gallagher's unit regularly and deliberately posed for pictures with dead bodies for trophy. It is unknown as to what the repercussion of the verdict will be on military policy.

TITLE=> Trump Says Election May 'End Up at Supreme Court'. ARTICLE=> Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death Friday left a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, one that's likely to play a key role in the 2020 election. President Donald Trump alluded to his concerns about ballot fraud due to mail-in voting in a press conference Wednesday, saying he thought the Supreme Court may be called upon to settle disputes about the election results. “I think having a 4-4 situation is not a good situation," Trump said. "I think it’s very important to have that we have nine justices.” He said he is considering five women to nominate, and that he would likely announce his choice Saturday. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight the fact that experts and fact checkers often push back on Trump's voter fraud concerns. Some voices from the left framed Trump's nomination and voter fraud concerns as an effort to try to control the court and the outcome of the election, and highlighted some GOP members' attempts to block those trying to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2016. The story received less overall coverage from right-rated outlets, though it was covered by several including Fox News and MarketWatch.

TITLE=> Calls Mount for Minnesota Freedom Fund Spending Accountability. ARTICLE=> The Minnesota Freedom Fund received backlash after the organization stated Monday that it spent "well over" $200,000 bailing protestors out of jail, despite having received $35 million in donations. The Minnesota Freedom Fund later tweeted a thread explaining they had already paid “all protest-related bail that has come our way” and shared how they plan to spend the rest of their funds. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum emphasized the need for transparency about where nonprofit campaigns spent their funds. Some voices from the left also criticized the Minnesota Freedom Fund's lack of diversity among the board of directors. Voices from the left also used the bond fund's growing popularity to highlight the movement to abolish cash bail.
TITLE=> Trump on Poor Russia Relations. ARTICLE=> A day after signing into law new sanctions against Russia, President Trump on Thursday blamed Congress for declining relations with the country.
TITLE=> White House Announces It Will Not Participate In Impeachment Inquiry. ARTICLE=> In a letter to House Judiciary Committee members on Friday, the White House announced that it will not participate in Democrats' ongoing impeachment proceedings, calling the inquiry "completely baseless" and in violation of "basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness." The 200-word statement, sent by White House counsel Pat Cipollone to House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, clarifies an earlier message that had left the door open to the administration sending counsel to represent President Donald Trump at future hearings. Some media outlets noted that the decision breaks with precedents established by earlier administrations involved in impeachment inquiries, including those of Nixon and Clinton.
TITLE=> Google, YouTube to Demonetize Content That Contradicts Climate Change Science. ARTICLE=> Google will begin preventing advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators from monetizing content that goes against "well-established scientific consensus on the existence and causes of climate change." According to a document published Thursday, Google will "look carefully at the context in which claims are made, differentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim." The company also said it will continue allowing monetization of content on other climate-related topics, "including public debates on climate policy, the varying impacts of climate change, new research and more." The document says "a growing number of our advertising and publisher partners" have complained to Google about purportedly false or misleading climate content in recent years. Outlets across the spectrum framed the move as a significant clampdown on content and speech by one of the world's most influential tech companies. Some coverage from right-rated sources said the move will undoubtedly suppress freedom of speech and non-mainstream views about the climate. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted how climate activists have been accelerating calls for tech companies to address climate change denial on their platforms.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Considers Trump Plan To Exclude People Who Are in the U.S. Illegally From the Census. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the Trump administration can exclude people who are in the U.S. illegally from the census report used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives. The Trump administration is appealing a September ruling by a three-judge panel that blocked it from including the number of people in the country illegally—administrative data from outside the 2020 census—in its official report, as well as from excluding these people from the total population count. A Supreme Court ruling in Trump’s favor could shift House seats, Electoral College votes and federal funding away from states with high populations of people who are in the U.S. illegally. Some coverage on all sides said the Court was “skeptical” of Trump’s plan but reluctant to immediately block it. Coverage in left-rated outlets and some right-rated outlets used the term "undocumented immigrants." Some right-rated outlets used the term "illegal immigrants." Some center-rated outlets used the terms "noncitizens" and "immigrants living in the United States illegally."
TITLE=> COVID-19 Vaccine Speculation Persists; Healthcare Firms Outline Careful Development. ARTICLE=> CEOs of Moderna and Pfizer, two healthcare firms working to develop COVID-19 vaccines, stated this week that their companies wouldn't rush development or compromise safety protocols due to political agendas or the 2020 presidential election. Meanwhile, vaccine trials and various experiments and studies persist, and speculation continues about how the treatment could potentially impact the White House race, and whether or not it'll be safe enough for the general public to use. Some conducted studies into public perception of the vaccine and whether or not people say they'll take it when made available. Some coverage from left-rated sources mentioned reports and analysis that suggest daily restrictions will continue after the vaccine is distributed. Some reports from right-rated outlets concentrated on analysis and experiments that suggest vaccine development might be quicker than expected.

Senators, including Democratic senator and vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris, asked Barrett about issues including abortion, the Affordable Care Act and immigration. Coverage from left-rated sources tended to frame Barrett's answers as deflective; some voices from the left criticized Barrett's choice not to comment on immigration, which she said reflected a policy debate she could not “be drawn into as a judge.” Some voices from the right pointed to Barrett's reason for declining to answer as evidence of her impartiality as a judge and a reflection of her character.
TITLE=> Nancy Pelosi Gives 8 Hour Speech on House Floor. ARTICLE=> Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held the House floor for 8 hours speaking about the need to protect "Dreamers," the longest continuous speech in House history.

TITLE=> Migrants Arriving at Southern Border Rose Significantly in February. ARTICLE=> U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said Wednesday that border agents encountered 100,441 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February. CBP commissioner Troy Miller said more than 19,000 of those encounters were families, approximately 9,500 were unaccompanied minors and the rest were adults. This marks an increase of over 100% in children and families at the border between January and February, and a 60% increase in unaccompanied minors. Roberta Jacobson, Biden's National Security Council coordinator for the southern border, said Wednesday that the prospect of "a more humane policy" under Biden "may have" contributed to an uptick in the number of migrants at the border since the new administration took office. Biden's immigration policies currently faces broad Republican criticism; the February number marks the highest monthly total since a major border surge in mid-2019. The news received wide coverage from right-rated outlets, and less coverage from left-rated outlets. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight Republican criticism and contrast Biden's immigration policy with Trump's. Left-rated outlets tended to frame the story as a "challenge for Biden."
TITLE=> Trump Defends McMaster. ARTICLE=> President Trump defended his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, on Friday after receiving criticism from some of his supporters.

TITLE=> Japan Restarts Commercial Whaling After Decades. ARTICLE=> After three decades, Japan has resumed its commercial whaling program. Last year, Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which banned whale hunting, but the country was granted an exemption for research purposes. Conservationists argue that whale hunts Japan claimed were scientific in nature were actually commercial hunts in disguise. While Japan is well known for commercial whaling, many Norwegians and Icelanders also say whale hunting is an important part of their culture and should not be banned. Some commentators have questioned whether the current Japanese market still has the same demand for whale meat as it did 30 years ago, while pointing out that much of the world has condemned whaling as a practice. Voices across the political spectrum point out that while commercial whaling openly defies the IWC ban, the whales Japan will hunt are not considered endangered or threatened in the U.S. by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Japan has continued whaling for what it claims are scientific purposes since a worldwide moratorium was placed on whaling in 1986.
TITLE=> Lawmakers Question Big Tech CEOs About Content Moderation Policies. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about their companies' content moderation practices during the 2020 presidential election. Republican senators questioned the tech giants about content moderation and the purported censorship of President Donald Trump and conservative voices; Democratic lawmakers focused their questioning about moderating misinformation and hate speech. Democrats also called for more legislation and regulation of the tech industry, including tougher data privacy laws, changes to a law that gives the companies legal protection for content posted by users, and greater antitrust action. Republicans also called for reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that protects companies from being sued over material users post on their platforms. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on Republican lawmakers' claims of anti-conservative bias; some right-rated outlets also noted that several major news outlets omitted the hearing from their evening newscast coverage.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Confederate Monuments. ARTICLE=> Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) recently announced the upcoming removal of a statue commerating Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Richmond, the state capital. The decision prompted voices throughout the spectrum to emerge with differing opinions on the purportedly racist existence of such monuments and the supposed importance of historical preservation. It is rumored that other statues honoring Confederate leaders in other southern states may soon come down as well. Some left-rated voices called for the removal of "racist statues", arguing that they glorify white supremacy. Some right-rated voices denounced recent instances of Confederate statues being vandalized, while arguing that the preservation of all history is necessary in civil society.
TITLE=> Storms Create Clean Water Crisis in Texas. ARTICLE=> The rare winter storms that have battered Texas and other southern states this week have led to a clean water crisis. Roughly 13 million Texas residents — nearly half the state's population — were told to boil their water as a precaution this week, amid concerns about contaminants and after hundreds of millions of gallons of clean water were lost in the state due to frozen and burst pipes. Many of the millions of Texans who lost power earlier this week have since regained it, but roughly 190,000 remained in the dark as of early Friday. Outlets on all sides reported on the storms, the lack of clean water, and the affected communities. Some right-rated sources focused on Gov. Greg Abbott's (R) calls for winterizing Texas' power supplies and restoring clean water access. Many left-rated sources also highlighted Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), who took criticism for vacationing to Mexico amid the crisis.

Buttigieg has now opened up a ten-point lead in New Hampshire over senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

It’s the first lawsuit filed against a media outlet by the voting company, which was a target of claims made by President Donald Trump and some of his supporters after Trump's election loss to Joe Biden. While several Fox News on-air reporting segments have debunked a number of inaccurate claims regarding Dominion, the voting company claims some at the outlet knew the claims were false but their comments were drowned out.
TITLE=> Book Says Gen. Milley Secretly Acted to Limit Trump's Nuclear Powers and Reassure Chinese Counterpart After Jan. 6. ARTICLE=> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley secretly contacted his Chinese counterpart before the 2020 election and after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a new book by The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Milley reportedly called his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Li Zuocheng, on October 30 to reassure him that the U.S. was not planning an attack after China raised concerns over U.S. military exercises and rhetoric from former President Donald Trump. After Jan. 6, Milley reportedly told Li that “We are 100 percent steady. Everything’s fine. But democracy can be sloppy sometimes.” Milley also reportedly held a secret meeting after the riot in which he reviewed the process for launching nuclear weapons and told senior military officials to only take orders if he was involved. Milley also reportedly held a call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 8 in which he agreed with her evaluation that Trump was unstable. The book, titled “Peril,” is based on over 200 anonymous interviews and will be released next week. Most coverage focused on Milley’s reported calls with Li. Some coverage in left- and center-rated outlets focused on Milley’s reported meeting with military officials; CNN said the book “recounts behind-the-scenes moments of a commander in chief unhinged and explosive.” Some right-rated outlets featured their coverage with opinion articles calling for Milley’s removal; a Fox News headline said Milley “worked with enemy behind Trump’s back.”

Especially contentious features of the potential bill include whether to extend unemployment aid, and how much money to reserve for aiding struggling state governments. Coverage of the upcoming aid from all sides of the spectrum has centered on the often polarized Capitol Hill negotiations; specifically what each party is vouching for, and what they oppose. Some reports from left-rated sources examined apparent internal disagreement between Republican lawmakers about drafting new legislation.

TITLE=> State Department Estimates 1,500 Americans Still in Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that as many as 1,500 Americans were still in Afghanistan. Of that group, Blinken said the State Department was in “direct contact” with about 500 and “aggressively reaching out” to the remaining 1,000 “multiple times a day through multiple channels of communication.” About 6,000 Americans were in the country when the Taliban took Kabul on Aug. 14, Blinken said, and about 4,500 of the 82,300 people evacuated by the U.S. had American passports. The new figures came less than a week before President Joe Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but Blinken stressed that evacuation efforts would continue for both Americans and Afghan allies, saying, “That effort will continue every day past August 31.” Most coverage across the spectrum focused on the 1,500 figure. Some coverage in left-rated outlets highlighted the 500 Americans in contact with the State Department. Some right-rated outlets framed Blinken’s announcement negatively; Fox News and the New York Post used the taglines “The Stranded” and “Still Stranded,” an apparent reference to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki’s comments from Monday.
TITLE=> More U.S. Troops Heading to Middle East. ARTICLE=> The Pentagon plans to send additional military personnel and missiles in response to last week's attack on a major Saudi Arabian oil outpost.

The numbers come as President Joe Biden issues a mask mandate for federal properties as one of his first presidential actions. The U.S. vaccine rollout has met several delays, partially due to a lack of qualified people to administer the vaccine; Amazon also reportedly offered to help the government administer vaccines. The story was covered by political outlets across the spectrum; outlets on all sides provided analysis regarding the vaccine distribution rollout and on whether Biden's plans to tackle the pandemic would work.
TITLE=> Navy, President Trump At Odds Over Eddie Gallagher's SEAL Designation.

In July, Gallagher was acquitted of murdering a wounded prisoner of war, but was convicted of posing with the prisoner's corpse in Iraq in 2017. The Navy is deciding whether or not to remove Gallagher's Trident Pin, the official membership pin of the SEALs; President Trump told the Navy to cancel its planned demotion of Gallagher from chief petty officer to petty officer first class last Friday.
TITLE=> Study Says BLM Demonstrations 93% Peaceful, 7% Riots; Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> A report released Thursday said that 93% of 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations "have not engaged in violence or destructive activity,” with 7% involving "violent demonstrations" and "riots." The report describes BLM as "an overwhelmingly peaceful movement" with violence "limited to fewer than 220 locations." These findings were based on data collected by the US Crisis Monitor, a joint effort between the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI). Public opinion differs from the report's findings; according to a recent FiveThirtyEight poll cited by the study, “42 percent [of respondents] said most protesters are trying to incite violence or destroy property.” Coverage in left-rated outlets focused on the claim that 93% of demonstrations were peaceful. Coverage in right-rated outlets focused on the 7% of incidents labeled as riots, with some coverage only reporting total numbers of incidents. The study received relatively less coverage in center-rated outlets, and this coverage tended to focus on the 93% of peaceful protests.

ARTICLE=> The Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) declared it will operate under "state of emergency" rules ahead of a grand jury decision regarding the case of Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician who was shot by police during a raid at her apartment. LMPD Interim Police Chief Robert J. Schroeder issued an internal memorandum Monday; the rules, which stops all days off and vacation requests for LMPD officers until further notice so “the appropriate level of staffing” can be ensured, are to take effect immediately. Earlier this month,  Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said he would present Taylor's case before a grand jury, though he gave no timeline for the decision. Last week, Taylor's family led a rally outside of Cameron's office last week, demanding the arrest of officers involved in Taylor's death. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum was consistent as of Monday afternoon.
TITLE=> CDC Says Vaccinated People Don't Have to Wear Masks Outside.

The company said it expects to apply for authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in early December if all requirements are met. The FDA requires a 50 percent efficacy rate for approval, though Moderna said it wants to have at least a 75 percent efficacy rate overall. The company expects the vaccine to be widely available in 2021; Moderna stock went up by 3 percent after its announcement Thursday, and the company is already taking in $1.1 billion in deposits from countries around the globe.

TITLE=> Netanyahu ‘Determined to Continue’ Gaza Strikes After Biden Urges ‘Significant De-Escalation’. ARTICLE=> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was “determined to continue” Israeli operations in Gaza after President Joe Biden told him he “expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire” in a Wednesday phone call. This was the latest of four calls between the two leaders this week; Biden previously called Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday, reiterating his support for Israel’s right to self-defense and voicing concern over the bombing of journalists’ offices. As of Wednesday afternoon, the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel has led to 12 Israeli resident deaths and 227 Palestinian deaths; Gaza's dense population and lack of protections like Israel's Iron Dome defense system contributed to the disproportionate death counts.  Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to frame Netanyahu as “brushing off” Biden and called Hamas a "terrorist organization." Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to focus more on deaths and damage from the conflict and called Hamas a "militant group."

ARTICLE=> The FDA and CDC have requested a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19vaccine after six U.S. recipients developed a rare disorder involving blood clots within nearly two weeks of vaccination, officials said on Tuesday. The officials said the clots appear to be rare, but people who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their doctor.

ARTICLE=> Dr. Rick Bright, former head of a government healthcare research agency who was fired last month, testified to a House subcommittee Thursday that the country lacks a sufficient plan for dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus, and “without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history.” Bright, who says his firing was retaliation from the Trump administration, was criticized for his testimony by administration officials, who said he had been failing at his assigned duties. Bright had been leading the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Left-rated outlets focused more on the details of Bright's testimony; right-rated outlets focused more on criticism of it from Republican politicians, officials and right-leaning pundits.

TITLE=> South Dakota to Send Troops to Texas Border. ARTICLE=> South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) announced Tuesday she will send up to 50 National Guard troops to the Texas border. “The Biden Administration has failed to keep America safe," Noem tweeted Monday. "We shouldn’t be making our own communities vulnerable by sending police to fix Biden’s border crisis.” She said a private donation will fund the deployment, which is expected to last 30-60 days. Earlier this month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) also pledged to send state law enforcement officers to Texas. The governors of Texas and Arizona penned a joint letter on June 10 requesting help from other states in handling illegal immigration along their borders. Republicans have been highly critical of the Biden administration's handling of immigration along the southern border. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight GOP criticism of the Biden admnistration, including Noem's statement and the letter from the Arizona and Texas governors. Some left-rated outlets highlighted criticism of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's push to build a border wall, calling it "political theater"; some outlets also highlighted the fact that Noem and DeSantis are seen as 2024 presidential election candidates. 
TITLE=> Arkansas Senate Passes Bill Banning Treatments for Transgender Youth. ARTICLE=> The Arkansas Senate passed a bill on Monday banning gender treatments for transgender minors, including hormonal therapy and surgical treatments. The bill awaits the signature of Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who last week signed two bills allowing doctors to refuse treatment based on moral or religious objections and banning trans women and girls from participating in school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Several states, including Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota and Tennessee, have also recently passed bills aimed at transgender issues and healthcare. Coverage in some left-rated outlets referred to gender treatments as “lifesaving” and labeled the Arkansas bill “anti-trans legislation.” Coverage tended to use the phrase “gender-affirming care” in left-rated outlets, “gender confirming treatments” in center-rated outlets, and “gender transition procedures” in right-rated outlets.

According to China's National Health Commission, the virus has killed at least 25 people and infected over 800 in the country as of Friday. Two cases have been confirmed in the U.S. as of Friday afternoon; both patients are reportedly in stable condition. While the Chinese government has restricted travel to and from Wuhan, some Chinese nationals have expressed frustration with the apparent lack of reporting and transparency on the situation. Some media outlets have focused on fact-checking details of the virus as news and information spreads online.

TITLE=> Iowa Caucus Results Begin to Emerge as Democrats Face Criticism for Delays. ARTICLE=> Iowa caucus results began to emerge Tuesday afternoon following apparent malfunctions with vote-counting technology after Iowans voted in the country's first 2020 presidential primaries Monday night. Flaws with the process drew criticism from both sides of the aisle. Many concentrated on how the delay would supposedly benefit President Donald Trump's reelection chances, while others were more critical of the caucus process overall.
TITLE=> Trump Fires Election Security Director. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has fired Christopher Krebs, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, for what Trump called inaccurate statements on the security of the 2020 presidential election. The firing came after Krebs' agency last week released a statement calling the 2020 election "the most secure in election history."
TITLE=> Texas, Missouri Sue Biden, Attempt to Reinstate 'Remain In Mexico' Policy. ARTICLE=> The state of Texas sued the Biden administration Tuesday in an attempt to reinstate a Trump-era policy that required migrants arriving at the southern border to wait in Mexico while applying for asylum, also known as the "Remain In Mexico" policy. The Trump administration implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in January 2019; before that, migrants could wait inside the U.S. for a court decision, which often took months or years. President Biden ordered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to suspend the policy soon after he took office in January. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, said the reinstatement of the program would "immediately remedy the influx of crime." In addition, the attorneys general are asking the court to award Texas and Missouri “the costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees.” The story received consistent coverage across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Economy Grew by 2.9 Percent in 2018. ARTICLE=> The economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2018, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported today. Some media outlets emphasized that the 2.9 percent figure, which represents an average of the economy's growth over the course of the year, fell short of Trump's goal of 3 percent. Others noted that when comparing the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017, the economy grew 3.1 percent.
TITLE=> Trump to Reject New DACA Applications, Renew Current Protections. ARTICLE=> The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that it will reject new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, but let current DACA recipients continue to renew their protections as the Trump administration reconsiders the program's future. This decision comes after the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from ending the Obama-era policy last month. The administration plans to cut the renewal window for current DACA recipients from two years into one and conduct a “comprehensive review” of DACA, which could potentially keep the program in effect beyond the November election. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to emphasize the administration's rejection of new applications, the renewal window being cut in half and the uncertain future of the program. Coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted President Donald Trump's vows to fix the program.

ARTICLE=> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has agreed to move toward a power-sharing agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). McConnell has dropped the demand that Democrats end the push to get rid of the filibuster after two Democrat Senators agreed to support the filibuster. McConnell said in a statement that "The legislative filibuster was a key part of the foundation beneath the Senate’s last 50-50 power-sharing agreement in 2001. With these assurances, I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent." A spokesperson for Schumer said "We’re glad Senator McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand. We look forward to organizing the Senate under Democratic control and start getting big, bold things done for the American people."

ARTICLE=> On Aug. 16, 350 newspapers across the U.S. participated in a coordinated campaign, encouraged by the editorial board of The Boston Globe, in which they published editorials pushing back against President Trump's negative rhetoric about the media.

The announcement followed reports that the U.S. plans to send 1.5 million vaccine doses to Canada and 2.5 million to Mexico. "We're going to beat this, we're way ahead of schedule, but we've got a long way to go," the president said Thursday. The news was covered throughout the spectrum, but highlighted more prominently by left- and center-rated sources.
TITLE=> Kavanaugh Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings Begin. ARTICLE=> The Senate Judiciary Committee launches confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, kicking off what is expected to be a partisan gauntlet.
TITLE=> US Appeals Court Temporarily Revives Texas Abortion Ban. ARTICLE=> The Texas Heartbeat Act (SB 8), a law that bans most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, was quickly revived by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday night. The Texas law went into effect on Sept. 1 but was temporarily blocked on Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman. The Justice Department has until Tuesday to respond to the appeal. The law grants private citizens the ability to sue anyone who helped provide an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; it allows for an exemption for "medical emergencies," but does not make any exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. Many Democrats have criticized the law, including President Joe Biden, who called the act an "unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights."  Right-rated outlets highlighted reactions from pro-life advocates that celebrated the appeal, including Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Texas Right to Life. Left-rated outlets featured comments that condemned the 5th Circuit's decision, including clinics that "are on edge" as they cancel abortion appointments.

TITLE=> Pentagon Implicates Iran in Attacks on Saudi Oil. ARTICLE=> Secretary of Defense Mark Esper blamed Iran for Saturday's attacks on major Saudi Arabian oil outposts via Twitter on Monday. He joins Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as other unnamed officials, in publicly blaming Iran. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that it "certainly would look" like Iran was involved and said the country was "prepared", but also said "we'd certainly like to avoid" conflict. Iran's president Hassan Rouhani has denied involvement, instead blaming Yemen. The ABC and WSJ stories both cite anonymous U.S. officials who describe military intel implicating Iran. The reports are similar in information, but certain facts, like the number of rockets fired, vary.
TITLE=> Senate Democrats Block Republican COVID-19 Relief Bill. ARTICLE=> Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-backed COVID-19 coronavirus relief bill on Thursday, perpetuating the partisan relief package stalemate. The proposal, titled "Delivering Immediate Relief to America’s Families, Schools and Small Businesses Act", included additional unemployment benefits, education funding and liability protections for businesses and health care facilities. The roughly $500 billion measure would cost a fraction of previous trillion-dollar relief bills. Republicans originally backed a $1 trillion bill, while Democrats passed a $3 trillion bill in the House in May. This most recent bill, which needed 60 votes to pass the 100-member chamber, was voted down 52-47. After the chamber failed to move forward, senators voiced skepticism that any movement would be made on a relief package before the election. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to emphasize the slimmed-down nature of the Republican bill; coverage from right-rated sources tended to focus on where the funds from the bill would go.
TITLE=> President Trump Backs Out of G7 Agreement. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Saturday pulled out of the G7 summit agreement hours after the White House announced they would sign it. Trump tweeted that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been "meek and mild" during meetings and was "dishonest" in the final press conference, in which Mr. Trudeau said that Canada will institute retaliatory tariffs and “will not be pushed around” by the U.S.
TITLE=> Trump Calls for Boycott of Goodyear Tires. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, President Donald Trump joined conservative commentators in calling for a boycott of tire manufacturer Goodyear after the company reportedly banned employees from wearing “MAGA” attire. Trump added that “this is what the Radical Left Democrats do,” and that “two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!” The original reporting of the ban cited a training slideshow photographed by a Goodyear employee. Goodyear clarified that while it did not create the slide in question, its policy was to prohibit workplace expressions supporting political campaigns and to allow expressions on “racial justice and equity issues.”  Trump’s call for a boycott was promptly covered by outlets on all sides. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed Trump’s boycott as an embrace of cancel culture.
TITLE=> Senate to Debate $2,000 Stimulus Checks, Defense Veto. ARTICLE=> The Republican-controlled Senate will soon debate whether to increase planned COVID-19 coronavirus stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000, and whether to override President Donald Trump's veto of a $740 billion defense bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) attempted to advance the issue of increased stimulus checks for a vote Tuesday, but it was blocked by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell said he's planning a Senate vote on the veto override for Wednesday; it's unclear when the increased stimulus payments may be voted on. The Democrat-led House approved the increase in direct payments to $2,000 Monday and also voted to override Trump's veto of the defense bill. Updated 12/29/20 at 1:06 p.m. ET to mention Tuesday morning's Senate activity.
TITLE=> Newly Released Documents Thrust Michael Flynn Case Back into Spotlight. ARTICLE=> The case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn is back in the spotlight after the Justice Department's release of previously sealed evidence Wednesday and Thursday. The unsealed documents include internal FBI notes, which suggest possible misconduct by agents influenced Flynn to plea guilty to lying to the FBI about Russian connections in 2017. Right-rated outlets are framing the news as more support for claims that the FBI actively moved to undermine the Trump administration. Many left- and center-rated outlets focused more on President Trump's reaction to the news, and speculation that Flynn could be presidentially pardoned; some left-rated voices were critical of Flynn, his legal team and supporters for purportedly pursuing baseless accusations against the bureau.
TITLE=> Rising Number of Migrants Arriving at Southern Border. ARTICLE=> The number of migrants coming to the Mexico-U.S. border is on the rise, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and border officials. Anonymous officials recently told Reuters that nearly 100,000 migrants were detained at the border in February, and that 4,500 were detained this Wednesday alone. DHS said more than 5,700 unaccompanied minors came to the border in January, the highest total for that month in recent memory; the department reportedly expects roughly 117,000 unaccompanied children to cross the border in 2021. The situation at the southern border has been framed as a brewing crisis by outlets across the political spectrum, particularly on the right and in local news outlets in border states. Some voices on the right, including former President Donald Trump, have accused President Joe Biden of encouraging a crisis with his rhetoric about immigration policy and by repealing Trump-era immigration rules.
TITLE=> Georgia, Louisiana Postpone Primary Elections. ARTICLE=> Louisiana and Georgia are the first states to postpone 2020 primary elections in response to the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus; Louisiana pushed its elections from April 4 to June 20, and Georgia from March 24 to May 19.

TITLE=> Jobless Claims Rise to 778,000. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans filing for first-time claims for unemployment benefits increased to 778,000 last week.

ARTICLE=> "The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election," wrote Attorney General William Barr in a letter to Congress summarizing the report. Further, Special Counsel Mueller did not conclude that Trump obstructed justice, but did not exonerate him on that point. That left the decision to the Justice Department, which concluded that the findings were "not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Christian Baker in Wedding Cake Dispute. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of Christian baker Jack Phillips who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. Some on the Left have said that the verdict is somewhat of a victory, as the Court's majority opinion does not sanction a First Amendment right to discriminate, but instead says that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission displayed a bias against Mr. Phillips' faith in his initial hearing. Many on the Right celebrated the decision as a victory for religious freedom.
TITLE=> Senate Republicans Use 'Nuclear Option' to Advance Trump Nominees. ARTICLE=> The Senate GOP voted to use the "nuclear option" to confirm many of President Trump's nominees with a simple majority.
TITLE=> Independent Panel Faults WHO, China for Slow Pandemic Response. ARTICLE=> A group of experts commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded this week that the WHO, China and other countries “lost opportunities” to take early action against the coronavirus pandemic. Experts said the WHO should have issued a global health crisis earlier; criticized China for implementing public health restrictions too late; and pointed out that other countries likely had COVID-19 cases in late January 2020 but did little about it at the time. The panel was led by former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark. COVID-19-related deaths surpassed 400,000 in the U.S. Tuesday. Right-rated sources covered the news more than left- and center-rated sources, and tended to note the Trump administration's criticisms of the probe and the WHO in general. Left- and center-rated sources overall focused more on the U.S. reaching 400,000 coronavirus deaths.

TITLE=> House Democrats Pass $3 Trillion 'HEROES Act'; Republicans Condemn it. ARTICLE=> Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives passed a new $3 trillion coronavirus relief package on Friday, the fifth piece of legislation aimed at easing pressures placed on workers and the economy by the pandemic. Dubbed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES Act, the bill includes another round of stimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits, and hazard pay for frontline workers, among other provisions. But the package has been met with criticism from Republicans, many of whom have rejected it as "a Democratic agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus pandemic.” Coverage of the bill has varied, with many outlets on the left focusing on its individual details and provisions and many on the right highlighting the GOP response. Editor's Note: A previous version of this story inaccurately described the bill as costing $3 billion, instead of $3 trillion. Updated 5/16/2020 at 2:08 p.m.
TITLE=> CDC Recommends Vaccinated People Wear Masks Indoors in High Transmission Areas. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday recommended that vaccinated people in areas with “substantial or high” COVID-19 transmission wear masks in public indoor settings. As of Tuesday, 46% of U.S. counties had “high transmission” and 17% had “substantial transmission,” including most counties in most Southern and Western states; every county in Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana had high transmission on Tuesday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the change came after new research showed that vaccinated people with rare “breakthrough” infections could spread the virus as easily as the unvaccinated. The CDC also recommended on Tuesday that K-12 students, teachers and staff wear masks indoors when they return to in-person school, regardless of vaccination status. The CDC previously said in May that vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks in most indoor settings. However, a surge in cases of the more transmissible Delta variant has led many states to see thousands of new cases per day, mainly among the unvaccinated.  Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets focused more on rising case numbers, sometimes including maps of high transmission areas. Coverage in right-rated outlets focused more on the CDC’s school mask guidelines, with some coverage focusing on criticism from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
TITLE=> President Trump Holds Christmas Eve Teleconference with Troops Overseas.

The president-elect said he has "great confidence" in Hunter and is "not concerned about any accusations that have been made against him," while also saying he thinks scrutiny of his son is "kind of foul play." Hunter's taxes have been the focus of an investigation by the U.S. attorney in Delaware since 2018; the probe was only recently disclosed. The interview was covered more by right-rated outlets and less overall by left- and center-rated outlets. Coverage from right-rated sources also mentioned the details of the probe into Hunter's taxes, and highlighted other questions about his foreign business dealings in China and Ukraine. Reports from left- and center-rated sources rarely mentioned these details, instead focusing more specifically on the interview with Colbert.
TITLE=> Reactions to Third Dem Debate Differ. ARTICLE=> Reactions to the third 2020 Democratic Presidential primary debate dominated the media universe Friday.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Lifts Ban on California In-Person Worship Services, Leaves Some Restrictions. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court issued emergency relief Friday to remove California’s ban on indoor church services placed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The high court's ruling comes after the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista and the Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena argued that the state violated religious liberty when it placed restrictions on in-person worship attendance based on COVID-19 cases in California. The order limits indoor capacity to 25% and still places a prohibition on singing and chanting during indoor services. The Court voted 6-3 in favor of lifting the ban, while leaving some restrictions in place. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they would have removed restrictions completely, while the three liberal justices dissented. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh said it wasn’t clear at this point whether the singing ban was being applied “across the board." Outlets from across the spectrum focused on the details of the restrictions still in place, as well as details of the different arguments by the justices. Some voices from the left and center framed the Supreme Court as "divided."

Several cities saw celebrations on streets where businesses had boarded up their windows in anticipation of potential unrest. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) and President Joe Biden received criticism from Republicans over statements made about the trial before the verdict was released; while the jury was sequestered by the time of Biden’s comments, it was only partially sequestered by the time of Waters’ comments. Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the case, said Waters’ comments might be grounds for an appeal. Voices in left-rated outlets focused on the pain of black communities and the impact of the trial on the wider racial justice movement. Voices in right-rated outlets criticized Waters and Biden, with some supporting the verdict and some opposing it.
TITLE=> Financial Establishment Criticized from All Angles Amid GameStop Saga. ARTICLE=> Voices from throughout the political spectrum are criticizing Wall Street elites this week for purportedly rigging the stock market against common investors. Small-scale stock traders, mostly by organizing on the forum-based platform Reddit, took on major hedge funds and investment firms in a trading frenzy this week centered around video game retailer GameStop. Widespread market volatility then prompted some brokerage services to limit certain trades and other functions. The limitations were supposedly meant to protect common investors, but many expressed outrage and accused the establishment of cutting off market access because financial elites were losing money. Among those speaking out against the alleged rigging were Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh and comedian Jon Stewart. Media on all sides of the spectrum covered the saga closely, as well as the many criticisms of Wall Street from public figures.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rules NCAA Cannot Ban Education-Related Compensation for Student Athletes. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously upheld a district court ruling that the NCAA’s restrictions on education-related benefits for college athletes violated antitrust law. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote the unanimous decision, argued that while the “national debate” around student athlete compensation was “important,” the Supreme Court’s only job in this case was to determine whether the lower court had properly applied the law. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a more forceful concurring opinion, stating that “The NCAA's business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America.” Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides, with many headlines saying the Supreme Court “sided” with athletes against the NCAA.

TITLE=> FDA Panel Recommends Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. ARTICLE=> A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel voted 20-0, with one abstention, to recommend Moderna’s COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine Thursday. Next, FDA officials decide whether to grant emergency use authorization based on the committee’s findings. Earlier this week the agency confirmed results that showed Moderna's two-step vaccine to be 94% effective at preventing the coronavirus. This comes after the FDA voted to authorize Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine last week.

ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the U.S. would purchase 500 million more doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to donate to other countries, bringing America’s total donation commitment to over 1.1 billion doses. The effort is motivated by Biden’s reported goal of fully vaccinating 70% of the world’s population within the next year. While the U.S. has fully vaccinated 55% of its population, many poorer countries have vaccination rates below 2%. “To date, the U.S. has already shipped nearly 160 million doses to 100 countries – donating more vaccines than all other countries combined,” the White House said in a Wednesday fact sheet on Biden’s Global COVID-19 Summit.  Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum but more common in left- and center-rated outlets on Wednesday.

Media coverage from the left and center focused more on the demonstrations and President Trump's input.
TITLE=> Louisiana State Senate Fails to Override Governor's Veto of Transgender Athlete Ban. ARTICLE=> Republican lawmakers in Louisiana's state Senate Tuesday failed to overturn Gov. John Bel Edwards' (D) veto of a bill that would have prohibited transgender students from participating in public school sports. Edwards rejected the bill that would have required athletes to compete on the team of their biological sex last month. To override a governor's veto, two-thirds of Louisiana's House and Senate must vote against it. While the state Senate voted 26-12 along party lines to override Edwards’s veto, the state House voted 68-30, narrowly missing the 70-vote threshold needed to defeat it.  The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Some coverage from right-rated sources framed the ban as justified; some reports from left-rated outlets framed it as prejudiced. 
TITLE=> CDC Announces Vaccinated Americans No Longer Need to Wear Masks In Most Indoor Settings. ARTICLE=> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walensky said Thursday that Americans vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus are no longer recommended to wear masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings. “If you are fully vaccinated, you are protected, and you can start doing the things that you stopped doing because of the pandemic," Walensky said. The new guidance still recommends wearing masks in crowded indoor settings like buses, planes and hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters, but wearing masks in schools or offices is not required. This comes as approximately 154 million Americans, or 46% of the population, have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and more than 117 million people are fully vaccinated. On average, the U.S. saw fewer than 40,000 new confirmed virus cases daily over the past week, a 21% improvement compared to the previous week, according to Axios.  The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from the right tended to speculate about the loosened restrictions' potential to accelerate reopening workplaces, schools and other businesses.

The somber death toll milestone was covered by media outlets across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Questions Surface About White House Awareness of Russia-Taliban Bounty Plot. ARTICLE=> Reports of Russian-backed bounties on U.S. military personnel raise questions about how much the White House knew and when senior officials were informed. Recent developments suggest President Donald Trump was informed of the bounties in February, a claim the president has denied. Left- and center-rated sources were more likely to focus on the president's supposed knowledge of the alleged conspiracy against U.S. forces, framing his purported inaction as worthy of criticism. Right-rated outlets focused less on specifics about Trump's awareness.
TITLE=> Republicans Draw 'Red Line' On Tax Hikes In Bipartisan White House Meeting. ARTICLE=> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he and Republican leaders drew a "red line" on hiking certain taxes to fund President Joe Biden's infrastructure spending proposal during the first bipartisan meeting with the top members of congressional leadership at the White House on Wednesday. Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill has faced resistance from Republicans in Congress, with disagreements over the amount and definitions of "infrastructure." The meeting also included Vice President Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. After the meeting, McConnell and McCarthy told reporters they both made clear that Republicans are not willing to budge on the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by former President Donald Trump. However, McConnell said "I think that it is safe to say there is certainly a bipartisan desire to get an outcome." Biden told MSNBC Wednesday after the meeting he sees room for a compromise, but will move forward on key aspects of his proposal without the opposing party if necessary. The story received wide coverage across the spectrum; coverage from both sides highlighted McConnell's and Biden's respective remarks, as well as the details of the disagreement over the package.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Afghan Evacuation Strategy. ARTICLE=> As evacuations continued this week for Americans and vulnerable Afghans out of Kabul, the conversation about Afghanistan shifted from the troop withdrawal itself to the Biden administration’s strategy for evacuation and withdrawal. Thursday’s suicide bombings, which killed at least 13 American soldiers and dozens of Afghans, added greater intensity to the debate. President Joe Biden once again defended the withdrawal on Thursday, telling reporters that he would not be deterred by terrorist attacks. Biden reaffirmed his commitment to evacuating all Americans who sought evacuation by Aug. 31 and said that evacuation efforts would continue for remaining Americans and vulnerable Afghans even after American troops left the country.  Voices in left-rated outlets were mixed, including writers who criticized the withdrawal, called for others not to politicize Afghans’ suffering, said the chaotic withdrawal was inevitable, and pointed to America’s 20-year military presence itself as the issue. Voices in right-rated outlets were broadly critical of the evacuation strategy and of President Joe Biden specifically, including writers who said Biden was incompetent, criticized the military’s coordination with the Taliban to provide security, called out a purported “kill list” of names given to the Taliban to facilitate airport access, and accused Biden of abandoning Americans. 
TITLE=> Trump Says Antifa Will Be Designated a Terrorist Organization. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that the far-left anarchist movement known as Antifa would be designated a terrorist organization amidst nearly a week of protests, looting, violence and riots throughout the U.S. following the death of George Floyd. Attorney General William Barr echoed the sentiment in a statement shortly after the tweet. Many on the left questioned Trump's authority to categorize the group as domestic terrorists, while arguing that Antifa is not an organization because it does not have a leader or centralized structure, and that there is no domestic terrorism law. Meanwhile, some on the right emphasized that Antifa has networks and cells across the U.S. and in Western Europe who radicalize and train activists to carry out organized violence.

The committee, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's rejection of two Republican recommendations, will consist of only two Republicans — Congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-Wy.) and Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). Many Republicans are denouncing the investigation as politically motivated and partisan; Democrats aim to showcase the extreme right-wing and the violence that occurred.

TITLE=> Trump Holds Town Hall with Undecided Voters; Media Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump held a town hall with undecided voters on ABC News Tuesday. Moderated by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, Trump took questions directly from the socially-distanced crowd in battleground state Pennsylvania. A wide range of topics were covered during the event, including the COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine, public attitude toward coronavirus public health measures, the economy and stock market, immigration and healthcare. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to focus on Trump's claims that he "up-played" the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as his "herd mentality" remarks. Reports from many left- and center-rated outlets framed the event as a "challenge" and compared it to the "friendly" environment Trump purportedly received on Fox News, where he frequently appears. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of Trump's responses, and his remarks about his accomplishments while in office.
TITLE=> Post-Election Protests Erupt Across the Country. ARTICLE=> Protests broke out in cities across the country on Wednesday, in some cases leading to clashes with police. Demonstrators on both sides called for counting every vote, while some sought to halt vote counting. Some supporters of President Donald Trump did both, chanting “stop the count” in Michigan and “count those votes” in Arizona. The National Guard was called in to Portland, Oregon after local police declared a riot, and New York City police arrested about 50 people in connection to post-election violence. Right-rated outlets published more coverage on riots and violence; coverage in left-rated outlets tended to describe such incidents as “heated.” Coverage in left-rated outlets also tended to point out Trump supporters’ “opposing goals.” Coverage on all sides paid particular attention to pro-Trump protesters outside a voting center in Phoenix, AZ.
TITLE=> White House Releases Details of Biden’s $2.2 Trillion Infrastructure Plan. ARTICLE=> The White House on Wednesday released details of the "The American Jobs Plan," President Joe Biden’s proposal for infrastructure investment and tax reform. The plan, which would spend roughly $2.2 trillion over the next 8 years, includes fixing roads and bridges, expanding broadband internet access and investing in America's manufacturing sector, as well as providing affordable housing and home-based care for the elderly and disabled. The plan would also raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, close loopholes and tax multinationals’ overseas earnings. The White House briefed lawmakers on the proposal on Tuesday. Biden is expected to formally unveil the plan in a Wednesday afternoon speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to highlight the poor state of American infrastructure, often including images of roads and bridges. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to focus on the tax hikes. While left-rated outlets tended to report the White House's stated "about $2 trillion" figure, right-rated outlets tended to report a higher $2.25 trillion figure. Combined, the individual spending proposals add up to $2.28 trillion.

TITLE=> Gabbard Votes "Present" On Both Impeachment Articles. ARTICLE=> Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), a 2020 presidential candidate, was the only member of the House of Representatives to vote "present" on both impeachment articles in the House vote Wednesday night. Gabbard blamed both parties for turning impeachment into a "partisan process, fueled by tribal animosities," saying "she could not in good conscience vote either yes or no" after reading the 658-page impeachment report. Gabbard introduced a resolution earlier Wednesday to censure President Donald Trump instead of impeaching him. Reporting outlets, regardless of political leanings, focused mainly on Gabbard's history of breaking with Democratic party norms. Some concentrated on reactions to Gabbard's vote from across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Trump Signs Series of Executive Actions to Provide Coronavirus Economic Relief. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump signed a series of executive actions Saturday to temporarily boost the economy amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Trump signed four orders that will provide an additional $400 per week in unemployment benefits; suspend payments on certain student loans until the end of the year; give renters protection against eviction; and instruct employers to defer some payroll taxes through the end of the year for those with annual income under $100,000. Trump said he decided to sign an executive order for the benefits after two fruitless weeks of negotiating with congressional Democrats. Many politicians from the left, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, criticized the orders as a "meager" solution. In a interview on Fox News Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warned Democrats that any legal challenge to these orders will delay relief. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight voices criticizing the orders, questioning whether Trump has the legal authority to give the orders, and the money to pay for them. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the economic plan.
TITLE=> Mayorkas Tells ICE to Stop Worksite Deportation Raids. ARTICLE=> Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a memo sent Tuesday to cease mass worksite deportation raids. Mayorkas said the Biden administration would instead focus on penalizing employers who hire immigrants without work authorizations, rather than the immigrants themselves. The memo also instructed DHS officials to consider temporary legal status for unauthorized immigrants who allegedly faced labor exploitation instead of immediately placing them in deportation proceedings. Coverage from right-rated sources often framed the announcement as an example of government overreach and an unnecessary limitation of immigration enforcement. Some coverage from left-rated sources highlighted examples of large worksite raids carried out during the Trump administration and juxtaposed them with the Biden administration's new directive.

Protests have escalated in the weeks following a bill proposal to allow extradition of Hong Kong citizens back to the Chinese mainland. Though the government insists that only fugitives would be extradited, protesters believe the passing of the bill would allow for more control of Hong Kong by the mainland. Some Hong Kong tycoons have already made plans to store their wealth offshore, according to Reuters. Protesters have called on several legislative figures to resign, including Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The 2020 Democratic National Convention Begins.

Some left-rated voices discussed the inclusion of Republican speakers; some left- and center-rated outlets perspectives focused on the convention’s internal party politics and purported historic importance. Some right-rated voices offered praise for Democrats; others were more critical.
TITLE=> Study Says U.K. COVID-19 Strain Spreading Rapidly In U.S.. ARTICLE=> A study published Sunday found that the COVID-19 strain known as B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom, is rapidly growing in the United States. The study found that while the new strain remains at low levels in the U.S., its case rate is doubling approximately every 10 days. Last month, a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicted that the more contagious U.K. variant could be the dominant strain in the U.S. by March. Researchers estimate the U.K. strain has spread to at least 33 states in the U.S., according to the CDC data, and makes up 2% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases, which may mean up to 1,000 people are contracting the strain every day. Some vccine manufacturers said the current COVID-19 vaccines are likely to work against new strains, but may be slightly less effective. The story was widely covered by outlets across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Statue of Liberty poem comment prompts criticism, misleading coverage. ARTICLE=> Ken Cuccinelli, head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, made an addition to a line of the Statue of Liberty's poem in a recent interview. He faced significant criticism as a result of the comment, which came after the Department of Homeland Security updated the existing public charge rule to withhold permanent status from migrants who rely on government aid. Several left-leaning media sources have published misleading headlines on the story, framing the comment as a formal change to the poem rather than a verbalization. Most right-leaning coverage of the story focused on the fact that the public charge rule has been around since 1882, and is not a Trump invention.

TITLE=> Debate Commission Will Mute Microphones at Upcoming Presidential Debate. ARTICLE=> The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced Monday that the presidential candidates will have their microphones muted while their opponent speaks during the final presidential debate on Oct. 22. The commission decided that the changes were needed because the candidates frequently interrupted each other during the last presidential debate. This time, each nominee will be muted while his opponent has two minutes to speak on each of the six debate topics. The remainder of each 15-minute block is open for discussion, without any muting. Thursday's debate will occur after the second debate was cancelled and each candidate held their own town halls on different networks instead last Thursday. Ahead of the debate, Trump criticized moderator and NBC reporter Kristen Welker for being "terrible & unfair." The story was widely covered by outlets from across the political spectrum. Some right-rated outlets noted that it was Biden who interrupted Trump first during the last debate, while some left-rated outlets speculated that the decision would "likely anger the president."
TITLE=> GOP-Led Audit of Arizona 2020 Election Results Confirms Biden's Win. ARTICLE=> A Republican-led audit of the 2020 presidential election results in Maricopa County, Arizona has reportedly confirmed President Joe Biden's victory. The original county vote totals showed Biden winning by 45,109 votes; the audit and hand recount reportedly found that Biden won by 45,469 votes. The audit was spurred by former President Donald Trump's claims that voter fraud and Democratic conspiracies tilted the election in Biden's favor. Arizona's state Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a cybersecurity firm from Florida, to conduct the audit. A draft of the audit was obtained by journalists before it was presented to the state Senate on Friday. State Sen. Wendy Rogers (R) tweeted Thursday that the draft "is only a partial report" and that Friday's "hearing will render findings of great consequence." Maricopa County is the U.S.'s 4th-most populous county. The news was covered prominently by major left- and center-rated sources Friday. Coverage from the left and center often criticized Trump and Arizona Republicans for continuing to claim the election was rigged against him.

ARTICLE=> The European Union removed the United States from its "safe list" Monday, recommending that its 27 member nations halt nonessential travel from the U.S. due to the country's recent spike in COVID-19 cases. To be on the EU’s “safe list,” a country can't have more than 75 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past two weeks. As of this week, the U.S. is averaging roughly 300 new cases per 100,000 people. Banning nonessential travel is still left up to individual countries. Meanwhile, the U.S. has banned nonessential travel from the EU since the start of the pandemic.  	Outlets across the spectrum covered the news, with few notable differences along partisan lines. Many reports were aimed at clearing up confusion around the guidance and explaining the requirements for travelers.

Protests broke out in Dallas Sunday as Jefferson became the latest example of deadly police brutality against black people. Dean was reportedly responding to a welfare check, and his reasons for firing on Jefferson are unclear; interim Police Chief Ed Kraus announced Dean's resignation Monday.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Joe Biden's 'You Ain't Black' Remark. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden's statement that black voters "ain't black" if they consider voting for President Donald Trump instead of him has been interpreted very differently in all corners of the political spectrum. Biden later walked back the remarks, saying he shouldn't have been "so cavalier." Many right-rated voices say the gaffe is the latest example of Biden's purported mental degeneration; a sign that racist ideals may plague members of each political party; and an example of issues with the left's "identity politics". Left-rated voices are divided in many cases. Some said the statement was "clearly" a joke; some viewed the comment as inappropriate and suggestive of Biden's supposed complacency in winning over black voters; some questioned if the comments really matter in the long run of the election; and some explored why black voters would still support Biden even if they were offended by his words.
TITLE=> US Adds 559,000 Jobs in May; Unemployment Drops to 5.8%. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy added 559,000 jobs in May, falling short of economists' predictions of 675,000 but more than doubling the 266,000 jobs added in April. The national unemployment rate fell from 6.1% to 5.8%, the lowest it's been since the pandemic began; this beat economists' estimates of 5.9%. Jobless claims also fell to 385,000 this week, a new pandemic low. Employment remains 5% lower than it was in February 2020. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were notable jobs gains "in leisure and hospitality, in public and private education, and in health care and social assistance in May." 	Outlets across the political spectrum covered the jobs report Friday morning.

ARTICLE=> During Thursday's White House press briefing, President Donald Trump asked a Homeland Security official if disinfectant or sunlight could be used as a direct treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus. The discussion created an online uproar over possible coronavirus cures, and led critics to accuse Trump of pushing unregulated virus treatments. Many left-rated outlets framed Trump's comments as "suggestions", and tied the discussion to deaths associated with hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug previously touted by Trump as a potential treatment. Some right-rated outlets moved to put the statements in context, pushing back on the notion that Trump was making reckless suggestions while debunking false and misleading statements about the discussion. Other reporting outlets focused on major cleaning supply companies like Lysol urging people not to use their products as medicine.

TITLE=> Harris Visits Guatemala, Tells Potential Migrants 'Do Not Come'. ARTICLE=> Vice President Kamala Harris told potential migrants not to come to the U.S. during her trip to Guatemala on Monday. In a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Harris said she and Giammattei discussed some of the root causes of migration and some potential solutions, such as U.S. entrepreneurial investment, anti-corruption initiatives, climate action and other initiatives that could help Guatemala build their country and deter migration to the U.S. “The goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home,” Harris said. “At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States – Mexico border, do not come, do not come." Giammattei also said in the press conference that the U.S. is reportedly working on a process with Guatemala to allow people to migrate to the U.S. through visas. This comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported over 178,000 migrants at the southern border in April, 17,000 of whom were unaccompanied minors.  Coverage from the left and center tended to focus on the details of the talks between Harris and Giammattei, as well as their press conference remarks. Some coverage from the right highlighted Republican criticism of Harris' handling of the border, including the fact that she has yet to visit any border sites. 
TITLE=> Biden Administration Cancels Military-Funded Border Wall Construction Projects. ARTICLE=> On Friday, the Department of Defense announced it will cancel all southern border wall construction projects that were paid for with military funding. In 2019, former President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in an effort to redirect funding to build the border wall. In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order halting all construction on the border wall so the administration could conduct a review; while that review goes on, the Pentagon said Friday the military funding would be returned to other projects. Pentagon spokesperson Jamal Brown said in the statement that unobligated military construction funds that were "originally intended for other military missions and functions such as schools for military children, overseas military construction projects in partner nations, and the National Guard and Reserve equipment account" will be returned to those projects. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimates that since 2019, more than 340 miles have been built in multiple locations along the border using Pentagon funds.  The story received wide coverage cross the political spectrum. Outlets from the left tended to focus on the funds that will be redirected from the border wall back to the Pentagon. Some coverage from center- and right-rated outlets highlighted Republicans who claim the move would be a blow to national security and question its legality; some also noted that the Government Accountability Office is preparing a report on whether the pause is legal under the Impoundment Control Act.
TITLE=> US Intelligence Reportedly Warned of Possible Taliban Takeover. ARTICLE=> Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that generals, diplomats and the U.S. intelligence community increasingly warned of a possible Taliban takeover in Afghanistan over the summer, even as President Joe Biden said publicly that such an outcome was unlikely to happen soon. The New York Times cited “current and former American government officials,” The Wall Street Journal cited “several administration and defense officials,” ABC News quoted “numerous U.S. officials,” NBC News quoted “U.S. officials,” The Washington Post quoted a “senior intelligence official,” and the Washington Examiner quoted Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas). On Wednesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said in a press briefing that “the timeframe of a potential collapse was widely estimated, it ranged from weeks to months, even years following our departure,” and that “there was nothing that I or anyone else saw that indicated a collapse of this army and this government in 11 days.” Original reporting on the intelligence community’s findings came mostly from left- and center-rated outlets. Coverage on Wednesday primarily focused on Gen. Milley’s remarks.
TITLE=> Trump Administration Seeks To End Asylum Protections. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to reduce the number of Central Americans eligible for asylum through new restrictions. Some on the left are calling the move the latest in a series of Trump's cruel efforts to keep out immigrants; others on the right say the United States developing a more structured asylum process is good for everyone.
TITLE=> Fauci and Rand Paul Clash Over Pandemic Origins, US Funding for Wuhan Lab. ARTICLE=> Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci clashed during a Senate health committee hearing Tuesday over the COVID-19 pandemic's origins. Paul accused Fauci of funding controversial "gain-of-function" research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China; the research allegedly focused on mutating animal viruses to infect humans. Fauci denied Paul's allegations, calling them "entirely and completely incorrect." Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) previously funded WIV research into bat-borne diseases and how they could affect humans. Questions remain about the ultimate origin of the virus, and whether it moved from animals to humans or leaked from a laboratory. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called the lab leak theory "the least likely hypothesis," while also saying it "requires further investigation." Former CDC chief Robert Redfield is among the lab leak theory's prominent supporters. The exchange between Paul and Fauci made headlines on all sides. Some coverage from right-rated sources framed the lab leak theory as more probable; some reports from left-rated outlets painted it as less likely.

TITLE=> Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew to Switch Parties. ARTICLE=> Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew (NJ), one of the party's few self-professed opponents of impeachment, is set to officially switch sides and become a Republican. An official announcement is reportedly expected next week; Van Drew's district voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. Reports on all sides focused on similar details. Van Drew reportedly met recently with Trump; several members of his staff have resigned ahead of the switch; and bipartisan criticism of he and his decision doesn't bode well for his 2020 re-election campaign.
TITLE=> Visa Restrictions Lead to Potential Complications for US Industries. ARTICLE=> Technology, healthcare and other industries could reportedly suffer worker shortages as a result of the Trump administration suspending the issuance of high-skilled foreign worker visas. When the restrictions were announced last month, President Donald Trump cited them as a way to potentially open up job opportunities for Americans left unemployed during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Outlets on all sides of the spectrum, particularly left- and center-rated outlets, have covered the ban's potentially adverse affects for U.S. industries. Both left- and -right-rated voices have agreed the restrictions could hurt American businesses and the country's "innovative capacity." Some coverage from left-rated outlets concentrated on how the ban is already impacting hospitals; some right-leaning sources examined the possibility that U.S. companies respond to shortages by moving research and development to other countries.
TITLE=> Tension with North Korea. ARTICLE=> President Trump warned a "major, major conflict" with North Korea could result from the ongoing standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he said he hoped diplomacy would prevail.

TITLE=> White House Aims to Have 90 Percent of Adults Eligible for COVID-19 Vaccine by April 19. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration announced Monday it plans to have the COVID-19 vaccine available to 90% of American adults by April 19. Part of that goal is also ensuring that all Americans have a vaccination site within five miles of their home. Biden also plans to more than double the number of pharmacies authorized to administer vaccines from 17,000 to nearly 40,000 by April 19; Biden previously pledged to have enough vaccine doses for all adults by May 1. The president also cautioned Americans to not "let up now" on COVID-19 safety measures, calling on state officials who lifted mask mandates to reinstate them. This comes alongside Biden's other goal of having 200 million vaccine shots administered in his first 100 days in office. The story received coverage across the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Sen. Jeff Flake Calls for Week Delay on Kavanaugh Senate Floor Vote, Requests FBI Investigation. ARTICLE=> Senate Republican leaders have agreed to pursue a brief FBI investigation into claims of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after GOP Sen.

TITLE=> House, Senate Democrats Call for Investigation of Barr, Durham. ARTICLE=> Four Democratic House committee chairs called for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to investigate Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham for their investigation of the Trump-Russia investigators Friday; their request comes one day after Senate Democrats made the same request. Democrats claim Barr and Durham made several public comments on the investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that violate a DOJ policy and that several of his actions "appear to benefit President Trump politically." This requests come after Barr defended his intervention in the high-profile DOJ cases during an appearance in northern Virginia Wednesday; during the same appearance, Barr also made comments against state-issued coronavirus-related lockdown orders. Some coverage from the left tended to frame Barr's comments earlier this week as Barr attempting to "give a boost" to Trump's reelection campaign. Some voices from the right praised Barr for speaking up amid the backlash his comments received.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden, Sanders Elevated as Dems' 2020 Frontrunners After Dropouts. ARTICLE=> Many reporting outlets and media voices, regardless of rating or political leaning, have framed recent dropouts by prominent Democratic candidates and growing support for former Vice President Joe Biden as an attempt from moderate Democrats to hinder Senator Bernie Sanders' (I-VT recent surge. Biden and Sanders are considered by many to be the far-and-away favorites for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, following crucial primary wins by each and a pair of dropouts by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (MN) and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each signaled support for a Biden campaign that appears revitalized, both by their endorsements and Biden's decisive win in Saturday's South Carolina primary.

TITLE=> Democrats Move to Raise Taxes on Businesses, Top Earners. ARTICLE=> Democratic lawmakers are acting to raise taxes on businesses and top earners, while also attempting to pass the Biden administration's $3.5 trillion spending plan through Congress and into law. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee recently proposed several key tax changes: raising the corporate tax rate for large companies from 21% to 26.5%; raising the top capital gains tax rate from 25% to 20%; and raising the top individual income rate from 37% to 39.6%. Meanwhile, Democrats say the pandemic-era Child Tax Credit will help to reduce tax burdens for the lower- and middle-class. Many Republican lawmakers have criticized the proposal, saying it could worsen inflation and unemployment. Coverage from left-rated outlets often concentrated on how the tax hikes could help lower-income people; some also highlighted pushback from moderate Democrats that could prevent the tax proposals from becoming law. Reports from right-rated sources usually framed the proposals in a negative light, and focused on purportedly wasteful parts of the Democrats' spending plan. Some right-rated voices accused the tax plan of harming small businesses; others argued that it still wouldn't be enough to cover the trillions of dollars spent during the pandemic and slated for future spending by Democrats.
TITLE=> Trump Played Key Role in Payments Made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. ARTICLE=> Federal prosecutors have evidence that President Trump played a key role in facilitating payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal that may have violated campaign finance laws, according to a new report by The Wall Street Journal.
TITLE=> February Jobs Report. ARTICLE=> The United States economy added 273,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%. Some center- and left-rated reporting outlets framed the growth as happening before the novel coronavirus began spreading in the U.S. Many reporting outlets also focused on the purported economic threat still posed by the virus, as well as revised jobs figures from January and December 2019, which boosted the number of jobs added to 273,000 and 184,000 for each month, respectively.
TITLE=> Pentagon Watchdog to Review $400M Border Contract. ARTICLE=> A Pentagon watchdog will review a decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to subcontract a Department of Defense job to Fisher Sand and Gravel (FSG), a North Dakota-based company which President Donald Trump has publicly supported. The $400 million contract involves border wall construction. All reporting outlets focused on Trump's support of the company. Some voices from the left and center made more prominent mention of FSG chief executive Tommy Fisher's donations to the Republican party and repeated appearances on Fox News. When the contract was awarded last week, some voices immediately questioned it.
TITLE=> EU Eases COVID-19 Travel Restrictions for Vaccinated Tourists. ARTICLE=> The European Union agreed Wednesday on a proposal to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions for visitors from other countries. A new list of “safe” countries from which travelers would be permitted is expected next week and will likely include the United Kingdom, among others. Only Israel, Australia and Singapore met the previous E.U. standards for unvaccinated leisure travel. While the United States might not meet the new criteria, travelers with an approved vaccine will be permitted to travel to E.U. countries. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to publish original reporting on this story.

TITLE=> While Covering Unrest, Some Journalists are Harassed or Handcuffed. ARTICLE=> Press freedom violations have been a side effect of the nationwide unrest in the wake of George Floyd's death. Law enforcement attempting to keep the peace have at times arrested or shot rubber bullets at reporters, while angry mobs have harassed and attacked journalists in other cases. CNN reporter Omar Jimenez's arrest in Minneapolis was the focus of significant coverage. Some voices looked at the apparent consensus among media members, regardless of political bias, that the arrest of Jimenez and any similar moves to diminish press freedom are unacceptable. Conversely, one report from a right-rated outlet concentrated on apparent discrepancies in how press groups responded to the arrest of Jimenez versus the harassment of a Fox News reporter in Washington D.C.
TITLE=> Conflicting Reports on Coronavirus Origins. ARTICLE=> As officials and experts continue to probe the origins of COVID-19, conflicting information has arisen about exactly how and where the novel virus began -- a fact that has also been reflected in news reports on the subject. Many outlets on the right have echoed statements in recent days by high-ranking officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Donald Trump that claim the virus was possibly leaked from a Wuhan lab, as opposed to a wet market in the Chinese city. Outlets on the left and center, by contrast, have pushed back on that theory, highlighting a lack of concrete evidence and other facts that suggest it unlikely. U.S. intelligence investigations around the issue so far have been publicly announced inconclusive.

TITLE=> Cori Bush Testifies Before Congress About 'Racist' Treatment During Childbirth, Faces Backlash For Using Term 'Birthing People'. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing examining the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis faced by black people; Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) testified about the “racist treatment” she said she and other "black birthing people" experienced during pregnancy and childbirth. Bush shared her own experience in which her voiced concerns went unaddressed by her doctors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports black women are more than three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Lawmakers introduced legislation seeking to combat these health inequities in February; On Thursday, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) announced that she and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also re-introduced the Mommies Act “to expand Medicaid coverage for birthing people & promote community-based, holistic approaches to maternity care.”  Bush's use of the term "birthing people" as opposed to a gendered term caused an online debate over Mother's Day weekend; Bush faced backlash on the right, with voices on the right criticizing Bush for purportedly reducing women to a "function" with her use of the term. Coverage of the story from center- and left-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of Bush's testimony, the mortality statistics, and legislative efforts to combat the issue.
TITLE=> Harris Looks to Stand Out From the 2020 Pack. ARTICLE=> Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), one of the first few politicians to announce their 2020 run, unveils new plans to stand out from the twenty two other candidates, this week.

Harris currently sits around 10% in both national and Iowa polls, but has shown a slightly downwards trend since Biden entered the race.
TITLE=> Partisan Divide in Coverage of Potential Coronavirus Treatments. ARTICLE=> Media coverage of the race to find a coronavirus cure has often divided along partisan lines. There are no drugs currently approved to prevent or treat the coronavirus; President Donald Trump recently stated that two specific drugs used in anti-malaria medications — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — may eventually provide a base for a coronavirus treatment, which the left and right sides of the media spectrum have reported on differently. Some left-rated outlets have focused on the death of a man who attempted to self-medicate with an apparent fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine phosphate; some right-rated outlets have concentrated on people who have seemingly used hydroxychloroquine to recover from the virus. Other outlets have focused on the facts about how the drugs are currently used, known limitations and side effects, and how they could be used in future COVID-19 treatments.

The group, which reportedly has fundraising commitments over $1 million and plans to run advertisements discouraging support for Trump, penned an op-ed explaining their decision in the New York Times Tuesday morning. Left and center-rated outlets generally covered the news more prominently, and focused coverage more on the purported threats Trump may face from within his own party.
TITLE=> US Oil Prices Cross Into Negative for First Time Ever. ARTICLE=> The price of oil went below $0 on Monday, as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues to slash demand. The crash came after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed on a landmark deal to curb oil production last week.

Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez's apparent celebration of the crash on Twitter, which she later deleted and rephrased.

The university responded by saying it does not plan to change its admission process, and called the report "a meritless, hasty accusation." Reporting was relatively similar throughout the spectrum. Coverage from left-rated outlets generally placed more of a focus on Yale's rebuttal.
TITLE=> Biden Admin to Send 1M Vaccine Doses to Retail Pharmacies Next Week. ARTICLE=> The federal government will begin shipping COVID-19 vaccines directly to retail pharmacies across the country next week. The initial rollout will send 1 million doses to 6,500 pharmacies, which will typically be located away from current vaccination sites and geared toward "socially vulnerable" populations; the plan is to eventually send more than 11 million doses to 40,000 pharmacies. The news comes as the number of Americans who've received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine has passed the total number of Americans who've tested positive for the virus at any point. Pfizer reportedly plans to distribute 200 million more vaccine doses by May; however, concerns are surfacing about how current vaccines will work against new and emerging coronavirus strains. Coverage of the expanded vaccine rollout was similar on all sides of the media, as was coverage of the new strains.

TITLE=> AG Barr Authorizes DOJ Probe Into Election Irregularities. ARTICLE=> Attorney General William Barr authorized the Justice Department to investigate allegations of voting irregularities before the 2020 presidential election officially concludes, according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press. The memo, addressed to U.S. attorneys, said investigations may be conducted if there are "clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State." Barr's authorization comes after President Donald Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani made allegations about voter fraud in the past week. All election disputes, including legal challenges and recounts, must be resolved before Dec. 8; the Electoral College will meet on Dec. 14 to decide the final results of the election. The story was widely covered by media outlets across the political spectrum; coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to frame claims of voter fraud as dubious.

The first bill, the Dream and Promise Act (DPA), would provide a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. The second bill, the Farm Modernization Workforce Act (FMWA), would provide legal status to farm workers and streamline the H-2A visa application process. These bills will be the first immigration reform bills taken up by Congress this year. Both of the individual bills passed the House last Congress, but were not voted on in the Senate. Each bill would likely need 60 votes to overcome a potential filibuster in the Senate. The bills received coverage across the political spectrum. Outlets from all sides analyzed the likelihood of the bills becoming law, and highlighted opposition by Republican lawmakers, including senators Dick Durbin, Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton.
TITLE=> Trump Says He Believes Putin on Russian Election Interference.

TITLE=> Biden Taps Harris to Lead White House Efforts on Immigration Surge at Southern Border. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris would lead the White House's efforts to resolve immigration issues at the Mexico-U.S. border, including a surge of incoming migrants and overcrowded Border Patrol detention centers. “I can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this” said Biden of Harris. “When she speaks, she speaks for me, doesn’t have to check with me.” The number of migrants arriving at the border has risen each month for most of the past year, but the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has spiked recently, leading to overcrowding  at some detainment facilities. Harris called the surge "a huge problem" in an interview Wednesday. The news made headlines throughout the spectrum Wednesday, and outlets on all sides highlighted the specific issues at the border. Right-rated sources often featured the news more prominently than left- and center-rated outlets did. Many reports from right-rated outlets questioned Harris' credentials on immigration, and recalled when she expressed support for decriminalizing illegal border crossings during the 2020 presidential campaign. Reports from left- and center-rated sources were generally much more neutral.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Veterans Day 2020. ARTICLE=> Since 1919, Americans have honored military veterans with appropriate ceremonies on Veterans Day, every year on Nov. 11.

ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden signed an executive order Thursday beginning the process of raising the refugee admissions cap to 125,000 from the Trump administration’s record-low 15,000 by fiscal year 2022. The change will require Biden to consult Congress before it can be implemented. The new cap will surpass the 110,000 limit set by former President Barack Obama in his last year in office. Biden announced the move, along with a broad set of foreign policy goals, during his first visit to the State Department on Thursday. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates there are 26.3 million refugees worldwide, including 1.4 million in urgent need of resettlement. Coverage in right-rated outlets was less likely to portray the Trump administration’s refugee cap as unusually low. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to portray the Trump administration’s policies as “hobbling,” “decimating” or otherwise harming the U.S. refugee program.
TITLE=> Trump Speaks at CPAC. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday in his first major speech since President Joe Biden’s inauguration.

It's going to unite and be stronger than ever before.” Several left-rated outlets published opinion, analysis and fact-checking articles criticizing the speech. Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to publish coverage on the speech itself, with several right-rated outlets publishing coverage of left-rated outlets' coverage of the speech.

TITLE=> FBI Releases First Declassified 9/11 Document Following Biden Executive Order. ARTICLE=> The FBI released the first declassified document pertaining to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. While a large portion of the 16-page report released on Saturday night remains heavily redacted, it unveils the FBI's investigation of a Saudi consular official and a suspected Saudi intelligence agent in Los Angeles who might have provided "significant logistical support" to the first plane hijackers arriving in the US. While the FBI document describes multiple conversations and phone calls, the Commission could not confidently link the Saudi men to the hijackers. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan reaffirmed on Sunday that his country has been advocating for the release of these documents for over a decade, claiming they "would completely show that there was no (Saudi) involvement." 9/11 Families United, an organization that serves thousands of families and survivors of the terrorist attacks, said in a statement that they believe the document "puts to bed any doubts about Saudi complicity in the attacks." After the group persistently pressured the White House to declassify the documents, Biden signed an executive order that ordered the Justice Department to make some files available to the public. Coverage was consistent across the spectrum as most outlets highlighted how the report did not include enough evidence to prove that senior Saudi government officials were involved in the 9/11 attacks. Some right-rated outlets emphasized how the Biden administration "didn’t seek any punishment" against Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, after a US intelligence report found that he directly approved the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

ARTICLE=> A 12-story Florida building partially collapsed Thursday, killing at least four peeople and injuring at least 11. 159 people remain unaccounted for as of Friday morning. Authorities responded to a call about the Surfside, Fla. condo building's collapse at 1:30 a.m., according to authorities at Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. 7 News obtained a video from the moment the building collapsed. "The building is literally pancaked,” Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said Thursday. "That is heartbreaking because it doesn’t mean to me that we are going to be as successful as we wanted to be in finding people alive.” Authorities say they do not know how many people were in the building when it collapsed. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis visited the site Thursday, joining Cava in declaring a state of emergency in Miami-Dade County. DeSantis said engineers have begun investigating the building's collapse, but that "we won't have the answers immediately." President Joe Biden said Thursday that the White House was "ready to move federal resources immediately if, in fact, we're asked for it."  The building's collapse was widely covered across the political spectrum. Some outlets featured those who helped out in the aftermath of the disaster, such as members of the Miami Heat basketball team, who brought supplies for first responders as they searched for survivors at the scene. Other local outlets suggested ways to aid the community. Some on the right highlighted the fact that Biden's remarks about Florida were apparently prompted by a reminder from Vice President Kamala Harris. Updated 6/25/21 at 8:31 a.m. ET

TITLE=> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Indicted On Corruption Charges. ARTICLE=> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (Likud) was indicted on corruption  charges Thursday morning, complicating an already contentious situation in Israeli politics; no government has been formed after two elections, raising the possibility of a third. Like the United States, Israel has never charged a sitting head-of-state with a crime. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing; allegations include making deals with media and journalism companies in exchange for positive coverage of he, his family and political party. Many reports, regardless of political leaning, made mention of Netanyahu's relationship with President Donald Trump.
TITLE=> Facts About Hunter Biden's Overseas Business Dealings. ARTICLE=> After Twitter and Facebook censored a story from the New York Post about allegedly corrupt international dealings in Ukraine and China involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, the younger Biden's emails have been the subject of media scrutiny. Allegedly discovered on a laptop abandoned at a Delaware repair shop, the emails reportedly suggest Hunter Biden leveraged his connection to his father to increase his pay from Burisma, a Ukrainian energy holdings company. The Democratic presidential candidate has previously denied knowledge of his son's dealings, and declined to answer questions from the media regarding the topic, calling it a "smear campaign." Some left- and center-rated outlets tended to concentrate on fact-checking claims published in right-rated outlets. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to place more scrutiny on Hunter Biden, and some right-rated voices criticized left-rated outlets for purportedly ignoring the story.
TITLE=> UAE and Bahrain Sign Peace Deals with Israel at White House. ARTICLE=> The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain signed peace deals with Israel at the White House on Tuesday, paving the way for full normalization of relations between the countries.

President Donald Trump says that other Arab countries may soon forge similar accords with Israel.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Earth Day 2021. ARTICLE=> April 22 is Earth Day, which is a day intended to demonstrate support for environmental preservation. Earth Day was founded in 1970 by nonprofit group Environmental Teach-In, Inc., an organization which campaigned heavily in Congress and was integral to the passage of the Clean Air Act. Activists typically stage environment and climate demonstrations on Earth Day, but this year, climate protests have largely gone virtual due to the pandemic. Some activists, not satisfied with President Joe Biden's climate agenda, dumped wheelbarrows purportedly filled with cow manure outside the White House during an Earth Day protest Thursday as Biden held a virtual international climate summit, urging world leaders to come together to confront climate change. The U.S. unveiled its goal to slash emissions by 50%-52% from 2005 levels at the summit.  Earth Day received wide coverage from across the political spectrum, with outlets on all sides covering Biden's global climate summit. Some left-rated outlets focused on data around climate change, and highlighted experts' tips on ways to combat climate change. Outlets on the right tended to focus on the history of Earth Day, and on the younger generations' growing interest in climate activism; some on the right also highlighted the White House cow manure protests.
TITLE=> Democrats Unveil Plan to End Government Shutdown. ARTICLE=> House Democrats have unveiled a temporary spending bill to end the partial government shutdown, although some say it is unlikely to succeed as it does not allot $5 billion for President Trump's border wall.

TITLE=> Rep. Ron Wright Becomes First Sitting Member of Congress to Die After Contracting COVID-19. ARTICLE=> Rep. Ron Wright (R-TX 6th District), 67, died Sunday night, becoming the first sitting member of Congress to die after contracting COVID-19. Wright, who first announced he had tested positive on Jan. 21, had also battled multiple bouts of lung cancer since 2018. A statement released after Wright's passing did not specify his cause of death. The news prompted condolences from politicians on both sides, with Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX 20th District) calling Wright “a gentleman who cared deeply about public service,” and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA 23rd District) saying he “led with principle, integrity, and thoughtfulness.” Most coverage from across the spectrum followed similar narratives and mentioned that Wright was the first member of Congress to die after contracting COVID-19. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to include data on COVID-19 cases and more likely to say Wright died "of" COVID-19.
TITLE=> Biden Asks Supreme Court to Cancel Border Wall, Asylum Arguments. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to postpone upcoming oral arguments and delay further action in two appeals regarding the Mexico-United States border wall funding and the "remain in Mexico" asylum policy, both filed by former President Donald Trump. The administration previously announced plans to discontinue construction of the border wall and suspend the asylum program. The court was set to hear arguments in the two cases on Feb. 22 and March 1. The Justice Department also asked the Supreme Court to suspend oral arguments in a separate case in March on the Trump policy requiring non-Mexican migrants to remain in Mexico until their next court dates in the U.S. The DOJ is expected to begin more filings as the new administration makes changes on immigration, LGBTQ+ protections, voting rights, healthcare and more. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Outlets on all sides highlighted Biden's clear agenda to discontinue border wall construction, suspend the asylum program, and reverse a number of other Trump-era policies.

Politico's editor in chief has stood by the decision, despite reportedly fielding complaints from upset staff members. Reports on all sides focused specifically on the feedback from Politico staff. Some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on past statements from Shapiro, often framing them as insensitive or hateful. Some reports from right-rated sources framed the pushback from journalists as hypocritical in light of journalism's connection to freedom of expression.

TITLE=> Google Denies Blacklisting Conservative Sites After Some Temporarily Vanish From Search Results. ARTICLE=> An apparent glitch in Google's search engine occurred Tuesday, temporarily removing certain websites from its search results. The websites noted as being removed mostly included several popular conservative news sources, as well as at least one left-leaning news site. Google fixed the discrepancy later in the day; Google's SearchLiason Twitter account wrote that "contrary to some speculation, this [bug] did not target particular sites or political ideologies." Mediaite and National Interest are the only left- and center-rated sources to cover the incident as of Friday morning, while the news received prominent coverage from right-rated outlets. Many right-rated voices denounced Google as biased toward conservatives, accusing it of blacklisting right-leaning viewpoints and decrying its purported attempts to influence public opinion.

TITLE=> Israel Bars Two US Congresswomen. ARTICLE=> Buckling to pressure from President Donald Trump, Israel has banned Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) from entering the country. This over chronic criticism that Omar and Tlaib have for Israel, and their support for Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions of Israel (BDS). Dissenting with Israel, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) stated that all Congress people should be allowed to visit Israel, regardless of their beliefs. AIPAC maintained its disagreement with Omar and Tlaib on Israeli issues. Left-leaning and right-leaning media showed great disparities in coverage. Some left-leaning media often point out that Omar and Tlaib are Muslim and this barring is prejudiced. Some right-leaning media used Tlaib and Omar's rhetoric as evidence of antisemitism, justifying the ban.
TITLE=> COVID-19 Cases Fall in US and Across the World. ARTICLE=> New COVID-19 infections dropped by 25% in the U.S. over the past two weeks, as the latest coronavirus wave has likely peaked in most states. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a 10% drop in global COVID-19 cases last week, and said cases in the U.S. fell roughly 31%. As of Tuesday, the seven-day average of new cases in the U.S. was 107,625, down from over 160,000 at the beginning of September. Meanwhile, deaths continue to rise following the summer Delta variant surge, and are up 4% in the past two weeks. Some states, particularly in the Northwest, continue to face crowded hospitals and staffing shortages.  	The news was covered across the spectrum, but not nearly as prominently as coverage of the Biden administration's spending bills and potential government shutdown. Some reports from left-rated sources urged continued caution ahead of the winter months, when viruses traditionally spread; others highlighted how COVID-19 remains a bigger problem in rural areas than urban ones.

TITLE=> Israel, Hamas Agree to A Ceasefire In Truce Brokered By Egypt. ARTICLE=> Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to a ceasefire after trading attacks and airstrikes along the Gaza Strip for over a week. The truce is expected to take effect by Friday morning. “The Political Security Cabinet unanimously accepted the recommendation of all security officials, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet [internal security agency], the head of the Mossad [foreign intelligence] and the head of the National Security Council, to accept the Egyptian initiative for a bilateral unconditional ceasefire," the Israeli security cabinet said in a statement, according to a report by the BBC. A Hamas official reportedly told the Associated Press, "“The Palestinian resistance will commit itself to this deal as long as the occupation is committed." President Joe Biden on Thursday hailed the ceasefire, commending Netanyahu for "[bringing] the current hostilities to a close in less than 11 days” and commending the Egyptian government for its key role in the truce. Biden also promised to marshal international resources to rebuild Gaza, saying “we will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian authority — not Hamas, the authority — in a manner that does not permit Hamas to restock its arsenal." Coverage from across the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the ceasefire and reactions from various officials and groups.
TITLE=> CBP Reports 212,672 Migrant Encounters in July, Reaching 21-Year High. ARTICLE=> Customs and Border Protection apprehended 212,672 migrants at the southwestern border in July, the agency said Thursday, a 12% increase from 188,000 encounters in June. Only 154,288 encounters were unique, however, with 27% involving migrants previously encountered in the last year. Many of the migrants were expelled, CBP said: “The vast majority of single adults and many families continue to be expelled under the CDC’s Title 42 authority, and those who cannot be expelled under Title 42 and do not have a legal basis to remain are placed in expedited removal proceedings.” While visiting the border, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the situation there was “one of the toughest challenges we face” and that it was “complicated, changing and involves vulnerable people at a time of a global pandemic.” Several headlines from across the spectrum, mostly from center- and right-rated outlets, highlighted that July's border encounters marked a 21-year monthly high. Coverage in some right-rated outlets referred to the large number of migrants as “grim.” Related coverage in some outlets, particularly but not exclusively on the right, focused on concerns of COVID-19 spread and recent overcrowding at migrant facilities.

Coverage in right-rated outlets has been more mixed, covering major events as they happen.

On Saturday evening, Trump called counter-protesters "Human Radical Left garbage" and "Antifa scum," and criticized D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for "not doing her job." Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame the protest as supporters "falsely" disputing the election results; some noted that members of QAnon and the Proud Boys were purportedly present.

TITLE=> Election Security a Focus on Super Tuesday. ARTICLE=> In addition to covering states and candidates, media coverage of Super Tuesday 2020 on all sides of the spectrum has centered on election security, possible voter fraud and the measures being taken to preserve voting integrity.

Pence and Harris will be separated by plexiglass barriers for COVID-19 safety, a move requested by the Harris team and criticized by Pence’s spokeswoman. Additionally, attendees will be escorted out if they refuse to wear masks. Voices in outlets on all sides varied widely in their opinions, with voices in right-rated outlets generally favoring Pence and voices in left-rated outlets generally favoring Harris.

TITLE=> Coverage of Trump's Holiday Speech Divided on Partisan Lines. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump gave two speeches over the Fourth of July weekend that covered everything from coronavirus, to monuments, to revolutions. In his July 3 speech at Mount Rushmore, Trump called for unity and said his administration was bringing people together amid a "left-wing cultural revolution" intended to "overthrow the American revolution." In his Independence Day speech, he expressed similar sentiments and echoed many of his campaign talking points. Some left-and center-rated outlets framed Trump's Fourth of July speech as divisive and inflammatory. Some coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated on his call for unity and for people to come together, with some even highlighting the way other outlets were framing Trump's speech as divisive.
TITLE=> UK Judge Denies Request to Extradite Julian Assange to the US. ARTICLE=> A British judge ruled Monday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could not be extradited to the United States, citing concerns for Assange’s mental health. Specifically, the judge said that extradition would be “oppressive” because the “near-total isolation” of a prolonged sentence in an American prison would lead Assange, who has been “either severely or moderately clinically depressed,” to commit suicide. The U.S. Department of Justice released a statement saying, “While we are extremely disappointed in the court’s ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised.” Assange faces charges of espionage and computer intrusion.

Emily Murphy, the Trump-appointed administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), has yet to formally ascertain Biden as the apparent election winner. Without this ascertainment, Biden does not have access to official briefings, funding and other tools necessary to facilitate the transition. Coverage in right-rated outlets focused on accusations of obstruction, with some coverage pointing to alleged obstruction by the Obama Administration during Trump’s presidential transition. Coverage in left-rated outlets focused on the GSA and national security concerns, with some coverage pointing to President Bill Clinton’s decision to allow George W.

TITLE=> Liz Cheney Says Trump is "Poisoning our Democratic System". ARTICLE=> In a tweet on Monday, Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) tweeted that former President Donald Trump  is "poisoning our democratic system" with his persistent claims that his November election defeat was the result of fraud.

ARTICLE=> The Keystone XL pipeline project was officially canceled this week after President Joe Biden rescinded a key permit for it earlier this year. The $9 billion pipeline would have transported roughly 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Canada to Nebraska, and was expected to create roughly 10,000 new jobs. It was first proposed in 2008, but faced ongoing protests and challenges from environmental groups and Indigenous communities. President Barack Obama first halted the project in 2015, but President Donald Trump approved a permit for it in 2017. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden pledged to stop the project once again. 	Left- and right-rated media often framed the news very differently. Coverage from left-rated sources tended to paint the news as a win for environmental activists and Indigenous groups, and focus on the pipeline's potential negative environmental effects. Some reports from right-rated sources instead highlighted local communities in South Dakota who were counting on the pipeline as an economic stimulant, framing them as having been let down by the cancellation.

Some coverage from left-rated sources concentrates more on data that suggest better polling for Biden; some reports from right-rated outlets focus on polls that indicate an advantage for Trump.

TITLE=> Vatican Denounces Gender Theory as "Confused Concept of Freedom". ARTICLE=> In a new document released on Monday, the Vatican rejected gender theory and the idea that one can choose their gender as an attempt to "annihilate nature." The 30-page document, called "Male and Female He Created Them," has been criticized by LGBTQ advocates as inciting hatred. The document rejects the concepts of "intersex" and "transgender" as characteristic of a postmodern culture and says the purpose of biological "complementarity" of male and female sex organs is to ensure procreation.

TITLE=> Demonstrators in Cuba Protest Shortages, Lack of Covid-19 Vaccines. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, thousands of Cubans marched to protest food shortages and the country's lack of COVID-19 vaccines. Chants of "freedom" could also be heard, leading some to speculate that protesters were speaking out against Cuba's communist government. In a country that surveils dissidents and has tight police control, democratic protests are uncommon. The Biden administration is supporting the Cuban peoples' right to peaceful assembly; some in Cuba say the U.S. and social media enabled the uprising. Many right-rated media outlets are framing the protests as anti-communist. Updated 7/12/21 at 12:46 p.m. ET with more detail on protester's intentions and media bias around the story.

Biden on Thursday called his team "bold thinkers” who “know how to pull every lever of government to take on the urgent, existential threat of climate change.” Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the goal of the Biden's climate response, as well as the diversity that the nominees could add to Biden's Cabinet. Some right-rated outlets pointed out that while Biden hailed his nominees as "bold new thinkers," the fact that some of his picks previously served the Obama administration suggest otherwise.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) the only vote against the bill. The legislation will now head to President Joe Biden's desk.  The story received coverage across the political spectrum.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Oscars 2021. ARTICLE=> The Oscars 2021 made history on Sunday, with Chloé Zhao becoming the second woman and first woman of color to win best director for “Nomadland,” which also won best picture. Best actor, which many expected to go to Chadwick Boseman posthumously, was instead awarded to Anthony Hopkins for his role in “The Father”; Hopkins paid tribute to Boseman in his Monday morning acceptance speech.

Because that’s where healing, where conversation, where change happens.” Voices in left-rated outlets often focused on racial and gender diversity at the Oscars, primarily focusing on Chloé Zhao and Youn Yuh-Jung (best supporting actress, “Minari”). Voices in right-rated outlets were more likely to criticize the Oscars as unwatchable. Some voices from across the spectrum praised Tyler Perry’s “refuse hate” speech.

The report follows news of jobless claims falling to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 last week. Reporting throughout the spectrum focused largely on these main facts.

TITLE=> Several Counties Defy Orders As California Placed on Lockdown. ARTICLE=> Several California county officials, including those in Orange County and Riverside County, have said they will not enforce a new stay-at-home order set to take place Sunday evening. The order affects Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley and five Bay Area counties. California added 21,528 new cases on Saturday, bringing the state's total number of cases to 1.3 million. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday he would enforce the stay-at home order in these areas if hospital intensive care unit capacity drops below 15%. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco criticized Newsom Friday for his "dictatorial attitude" and purportedly acting "extremely hypocritical"; Orange County followed with a similar statement Saturday. Under the new restrictions, gatherings of people from different households will be prohibited except for outdoor church services and protests. Personal and recreational services will be closed. Restaurants will remain open for delivery and takeout only, and retail will remain open at 20% capacity.

TITLE=> Election Coverage: Is Texas a Swing State?. ARTICLE=> This week,  presidential election projections from NBC News (Lean Left) and Cook Political Report (Center) both moved Texas from “lean Republican” to “toss up.” RealClearPolitics (Center) also marks Texas as a toss up, and FiveThirtyEight (Center) predicts President Donald Trump has a 70% chance to win the state. Over 7 million Texans have already voted early, just 2 million less than the total amount of Texas votes cast in 2016. With Texas’ 38 electoral college votes, the historically red state could have a significant impact on the election's outcome. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win Texas was Jimmy Carter in 1976. Coverage was generally balanced on all sides, often covering voter turnout and recent polling data. Some outlets on all sides also featured analysis on Texas’ long-term political future.
TITLE=> More Than 5 Million Americans Missed Second Vaccine Dose. ARTICLE=> Nearly eight percent of the people who received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose — roughly 5 million Americans — didn't return for the second shot, according to a New York Times report. The report cites the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which only included people who got their first Moderna dose by March 7 or first Pfizer dose by March 14. Each of these vaccines requires two doses spread several weeks apart. The Times quotes some people who said their pharmacies messed up their second dose appointments, as well as public health officials and experts who expressed concerns about the vaccine follow-through rate. The Times also goes on to call the 92% follow-through rate "strong by historical standards." The news was covered across the spectrum, but rarely featured prominently by news outlets regardless of bias. Some coverage from right-rated outlets framed the news as indicative of the need for effective one-shot vaccines. Some reports, often from local outlets, contrasted high vaccine follow-through rates in their area with the national average mentioned earlier. Other recent coverage has focused on two recent studies, from the Penn Institute of Immunology and the New England Journal of Medicine, which suggest that people who already had COVID-19 might not need the second dose.
TITLE=> 8 Dead in Atlanta Shootings, Suspect Claims ‘Sexual Addiction’ as Motive. ARTICLE=> Eight people, including six Asian women, were killed in shootings at three Atlanta-area massage parlors. Atlanta police said that the suspect, a 21-year-old white man, “has some issues, potentially sexual addiction,” and that he was "attempting to take out that temptation”; police also noted that “indicators right now are [the shootings] may not be” racially motivated. The violence occurred amid a national rise in anti-Asian hate incidents, prompting some to speculate that the shootings were racially motivated. While outlets from across the spectrum reported on the suspect’s self-declared lack of racial motivation, left-rated outlets tended to place more emphasis on concerns of anti-Asian violence. Left-rated outlets were also more likely to prominently feature coverage of the shootings; some right-rated outlets instead highlighted coverage of the effort to remove California Governor Gavin Newsom.
TITLE=> FDA, CDC Say Vaccinated People Don't Need COVID-19 Booster Shot 'At This Time'. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a joint statement released Thursday that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need a third "booster" shot at this time. The statement also stressed that people who are fully vaccinated are protected from the Delta variant, which is now the dominant strain in the U.S. and in other countries. Meanwhile, Pfizer is expected to seek authorization for a third shot after an internal study found that that a third dose of its vaccine was five to 10 times better at defeating the virus than two doses. 	The news was covered across the political spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated sources focused more on Pfizer's plans to develop a booster shot and highlighted concerns about the Delta variant. Some reports from right-rated outlets put less emphasis on the "at this time" detail of the FDA-CDC statement, and typically focused on data that suggests vaccines are effective.

Secretary General Antonio Guterres about a “completely dysfunctional” U.S.-China relationship, saying, “We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs.” Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to address the U.N. on Tuesday in a pre-recorded video.  Some coverage in center- and right-rated outlets focused on “strained” U.S. relations with countries like France; Washington Examiner, for instance, said that Biden’s “own recent diplomacy missteps diluted his message.” Some coverage in center- and left-rated outlets contrasted Biden’s speech with the “America First” rhetoric of former President Donald Trump.
TITLE=> FTC Files Updated Antitrust Complaint Against Facebook. ARTICLE=> The Federal Trade Commission filed an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook on Thursday, adding new evidence and claiming that the tech giant had maintained a monopoly since 2011. The new suit came after a federal judge blocked a previous antitrust complaint against Facebook in June. FTC Chair Lina Khan, a critic of big tech companies, cast the deciding vote on the complaint despite Facebook’s request that she recuse herself. In a statement, the FTC’s acting Bureau of Competition director Holly Vedova said, “After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.” Facebook responded in a statement, saying, “The FTC’s claims are an effort to rewrite antitrust laws and upend settled expectations of merger review, declaring to the business community that no sale is ever final.” Coverage was generally balanced across the spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets featured the story more prominently than right-rated outlets on Thursday evening, as homepages across the spectrum were dominated by Afghanistan.

The administration's withdrawal from the WHO is in response to its handling of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

Some left-rated voices focused on the fact that the president did not make mention of the Minneapolis riots over George Floyd's death during the press conference, and did not take any questions from the media.

ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden is expected to issue an order Friday keeping the current record-low 15,000 refugee admissions cap and eliminating Trump-era restrictions on which refugees qualify for resettlement, which some officials said would speed the resettlement process. Biden previously announced plans to raise refugee admissions to 125,000 in fiscal year 2022, with the State Department planning to accept 62,500 in 2021. Despite those plans, the Biden administration has been on track to accept the lowest number of refugees since 1980. A group of House Democrats led by Rep. Ilhan Omar sent a letter Friday morning urging Biden to raise the refugee cap, after reports surfaced of refugees having their applications canceled “at the last minute, in some cases having already left their residences and sold their belongings.” The United Nations estimates there are about 80 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, 26.3 million of whom are classified as refugees. Coverage was blunter in portraying the decision as a “reversal” in some left- and right-rated outlets than in center-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Trump Pushes for Bigger COVID-19 Relief Checks. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump criticized the COVID-19 coronavirus relief bill Tuesday, saying it should be amended to increase the amount in the stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 (or $4,000 per couple).

TITLE=> Hunter Biden's Taxes Under Federal Investigation.

The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the Justice Department has also been scrutinizing Hunter Biden’s taxes, Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions since 2018. The younger Biden's statement said he did not learn of the investigation until Tuesday. This comes after political opponents, including President Donald Trump, criticized Hunter Biden for his dealings with Ukraine and China and accused Joe Biden of profiting off of his son's business deals. The story was widely covered by outlets across the spectrum. Coverage from the right tended to highlight the Biden family's financial and tax history; some center-rated outlets pointed out that Biden's pick for attorney general could oversee the investigation into his son if it continues past Jan. 20. Some reports from left-rated sources focused on the Trump campaign's scrutiny of Hunter Biden during the presidential campaign.
TITLE=> Early Voting Breaks Records; Which Party Will Benefit?. ARTICLE=> More than 80 million people in the United States have reportedly cast their presidential vote early ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, including many in crucial swing states. 58 million people voted early in the 2016 presidential election, but the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic prompted expanded early-voting efforts this year. The voting data is collected by the US Elections Project; over 17 million of this year's early votes reportedly came from people who didn't vote or weren't eligible to vote in 2016. Reports throughout the spectrum focused on younger voters turning out early, and broke down whether Democrats or Republicans may benefit more from early voting. Some reports from both sides alluded to an early-voting advantage for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, while acknowledging that President Donald Trump is expected to see a surge of votes at the polls Tuesday. A CNN report looked at how "Republicans are narrowing the early voting gap," and some coverage from right-rated outlets took a similar angle; an opinion from American Spectator inspected "Democrat delusions about early voting."

TITLE=> Viral 'Plandemic' Video Prompts Social Media Frenzy. ARTICLE=> A viral video promoting an alternative theory to the coronavirus pandemic triggered a wave of controversy on social media this week, underscoring the way conflicting information and misinformation can spread during a crisis. The video, posted to YouTube and titled "Plandemic: Part I", features a former National Cancer Institute researcher suggesting that the coronavirus was a "planned" conspiracy and positing a number of false or misleading claims. The video received millions of views before YouTube removed it for violating its policy against "COVID-19 misinformation." Outlets across the aisle covered the video and reactions to it, with many publications seeking to counter the interviewee's dubious narrative with fact checks and analysis. Those on the left were more likely to call the video's contents false outright, while those on the right focused more on its removal from YouTube and other platforms. Editorial note: AllSides is not doing an independent analysis of the claims in the documentary or of the coverage of it, and notes that any false or misleading claims within the documentary do not mean everything in the documentary was false. In the current online environment filled with bias, hidden agendas and misinformation, we recommend a healthy dose of skepticism and critical thought. Updated 5/11/2020 at 4:59 p.m. ET

Andrew Cuomo's administration may have underreported COVID-19 nursing home deaths by as much as 50%, according to a 76-page report released Thursday by N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James. This was in part due to a New York Department of Health policy of not counting nursing home occupants who died after transferring to a hospital. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio reacted to the news in a Thursday press conference, saying, “we have to get the full truth…we have to be honest about the numbers.” Coverage came mostly from center- and right-rated outlets, with only right-rated outlets featuring the story prominently on homepages.

TITLE=> Harris's Staff Dissatisfied With 'Dysfunctional' Work Environment. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, Politico reported that aides and officials on Vice President Kamala Harris's staff were dissatisfied with their work environment, with some calling it "tense" and "dysfunctional." Much of the criticism is aimed at Harris' chief of staff, Tina Flournoy; Flournoy reportedly restricts staff and allies' access to Harris, creating tension in the office and among outside donors and supporters. According to Politico, Harris's recent announcement of her trip to the southern border left her staff "scrambling" with little time to make necessary preparations. While Flournoy was heavily criticized, two anonymous administration officials said Harris is ultimately responsible for the way her office is run. Harris's spokesperson Symone Sanders told Politico that staff should raise issues directly, and called the anonymous officials "cowards." Sanders said, "We are not making rainbows and bunnies all day. What I hear is that people have hard jobs and I’m like ‘welcome to the club.' " After Politico first published the story, it was widely covered by right-rated outlets and received little coverage from left-rated outlets. Some left-rated outlets raised the issue of a double standard for women and men in power, ard argued that men would not be criticized for having a "tough and demanding" office environment. Some right-rated outlets also tended to highlight criticism of Harris's handling of her immigration assignment. 
TITLE=> In Times of Crisis and Social Distancing, Americans Still Find Community. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 coronavirus has emerged as a national and global crisis, prompting much of the U.S. to treat it as a grave threat to American life and prosperity. But during these tumultuous times, many Americans are going above and beyond to serve and strengthen their communities, uplift the needy, and maintain a sense of unity in the face of quarantines and heightened risk around social interaction.

TITLE=> New York May Call On National Guard To Replace Unvaccinated Healthcare Workers. ARTICLE=> With tens of thousands of health care employees likely to miss New York’s approaching deadline for mandated vaccinations, Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering employing the National Guard and out-of-state medical workers to fill hospital staffing shortages. In a statement issued on Saturday, Hochul said she plans on declaring a state of emergency that would “allow qualified health care professionals licensed in other states or countries, recent graduates, retired and formerly practicing health care professionals to practice in New York State.” Last month, the New York State Department of Health announced a new mandate that requires all healthcare workers to get at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 27. According to the governor's office, about 16% (70,000 healthcare workers) have not been fully vaccinated to date. Healthcare employees who are fired for not adhering to the guideline will not be eligible for unemployment insurance unless they provide "a valid doctor-approved request for medical accommodation." Sources from the left and center were more likely to emphasize how COVID-19 death tolls continue to rise across the country, notably in the unvaccinated. Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how some "unions and administrators" asked Hochul to postpone the deadline, but also linked to surveys that reported a majority of Americans support vaccine mandates.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Trump Administration and Inspectors General. ARTICLE=> The removal of State Department Inspector General Steve Linick on Friday marked the fourth time in six weeks a federal watchdog has been ousted by the Trump administration. Questions regarding what Linick and others did to deserve being fired are fueling speculation about possible White House retaliation against perceived internal threats; inspectors general are assigned to each executive branch agency to monitor agency operations and probe supposed cases of misconduct or abuse. Many reports indicate that Linick was investigating potential State Department misconduct in completing a $7 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year. Many left-rated voices have framed the firings as "dangerous" abuses of power, arguing that Trump is creating a tyrannical precedent for future presidents to follow. Some right-rated voices moved to justify Trump's purported efforts to fire officials who he thinks undermine his ability to fulfill presidential duties.
TITLE=> Trump Leaves White House for Last Time as President. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump left the White House for the last time as president on Wednesday morning, telling reporters, “I just want to say goodbye—but hopefully it’s not a long-term goodbye. We’ll see each other again.” Trump flew on Marine One to Joint Base Andrews, where he spoke to a gathering of his supporters, thanked his family, and wished the new administration “great luck and great success.” Trump then boarded Air Force One to fly to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. While Trump did not attend President Joe Biden’s inauguration, as all but three of his predecessors had done, he did continue the tradition of leaving a note for the incoming president. Reporting in some left-rated outlets, particularly CNN, described Trump’s departure in less favorable terms, describing him as a “pariah” and noting First Lady Melania Trump’s historically low approval rating. Coverage in some right-rated outlets took a more positive angle, pointing to a “booming economy” and the popularity among Republicans of some of Trump’s accomplishments.
TITLE=> House Delivers Article Of Impeachment Against Trump To Senate. ARTICLE=> House of Representatives impeachment managers, led by the House Clerk and the Acting House Sergeant at Arms, delivered the article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate floor Monday. The article charges Trump with inciting insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6. The House voted 232-197 on Jan. 13 to impeach Trump, with 10 Republicans voting in favor. Members are set to be sworn in for trial on Tuesday, and the trial will begin Feb. 9. The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Both the left and the right provided speculation on how different senators, particularly GOP senators, may vote on the impeachment. Some left-rated outlets tended to analyze how the impeachment managers might build their case.
TITLE=> CDC and FDA Advise White House To Slow Down Booster Shot Plan. ARTICLE=> The heads of two leading federal health agencies have advised the White House to slow down its plan to roll out COVID-19 vaccine boosters. In a meeting with White House pandemic coordinator Jeffrey Zients on Thursday, FDA acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock and CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said they needed more time to collect and review all necessary data regarding the booster shots. In August, President Biden announced that the government would offer third shots starting Sept. 20 to those who received the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines at least eight months ago. Chris Meagher, a White House spokesperson, commented on the meeting earlier on Friday, ensuring that they would "always follow the science" and will wait for full approval from the FDA as well as a recommendation from the CDC before moving forward with any booster shot plan. Coverage was consistent across the spectrum, sticking close to the original New York Times (Lean Left bias) report. Most stories also highlighted how two top FDA officials are stepping down from their positions because they are frustrated with the Biden administration’s purportedly premature decision to weigh in on booster shots.
TITLE=> FDA Panel Recommends Booster Shots for Individuals Over 65 and at High Risk. ARTICLE=> An FDA advisory panel voted unanimously in favor of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for individuals 65 and older and those at high risk of severe COVID-19 after rejecting booster shots for everyone 16 and older by a vote of 16-2. The panel’s vote influences but does not determine the ultimate decision for approval. Over 2 million Americans have received a booster shot since August 13, according to CDC data released Friday.  Coverage across the spectrum varied on framing the votes as a rejection of the “16 and older” approval or an endorsement of the “65 and older” approval. Because the “65 and older” vote was not originally planned and came after the “16 and older” vote, some coverage shortly after the panel’s meeting said only that the panel “rejected” booster shots. Coverage in some outlets framed the votes as a blow to the Biden administration’s plans to widely distribute booster shots. 
TITLE=> Wisconsin Senate Passes Measure to Restrict Power of Incoming Democratic Governor. ARTICLE=> The Republican-controlled Wisconsin state legislature passed a measure to weaken the power of Democratic Governor-elect Tony Evers and Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul.

The China-Hong Kong relationship has come back into focus alongside concerns about China's management of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and reports of renewed trade tensions with the U.S. Many voices throughout the media spectrum, regardless of political bias, framed the situation as an example of another Chinese attempt to exert control over Hong Kong and its residents. Some questioned how the newfound tension, paired with accusations of a Chinese pandemic cover-up and potentially increased U.S. dependence on Chinese imports, will reshape the U.S.-China relationship going forward.
TITLE=> Sanders Apparent Winner in Nevada. ARTICLE=> Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appeared to win significantly in Nevada's Democratic caucuses Saturday, prompting media outlets on all sides of the political spectrum to frame his case for the party's 2020 presidential nomination as an increasingly strong one.

Right outlets reporting that it is 'not just a gun issue,' and left outlets reporting on a call for action on gun laws.
TITLE=> Biden's First Days In Office Will Focus On COVID-19, Economy, Climate. ARTICLE=> President-elect Joe Biden will sign approximately a dozen executive orders regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, and climate change during his first few weeks in office, according to a memo by Ron Klain, who is set to become the White House Chief of Staff. On day one, Biden would sign actions rejoining the United States to the Paris climate accord and reversing Trump's travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries. The president-elect will halt evictions and student loan payments during the pandemic, and will establish a mask mandate on all federal property during the first 100 days of his term.

TITLE=> Italy's Strict New Vaccine Mandate Prompts Protests. ARTICLE=> Italy's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, believed to be among the strictest government COVID-19 mandates in the world, has been met by protests. The newest rule requires all private and public employees in Italy to show proof of vaccination, a negative test result, or recovery from COVID-19 in the past six months with what's known as a "Green Pass." Workers could be fined up to 1,500 euros, or roughly $1,750, for failing to comply with the new rule. Hundreds of port workers in the northeastern city of Trieste protested the rule over the weekend, and hundreds more attended an anti-mandate demonstration in Florence. Last week, thousands of people marched in Rome earlier this month in opposition of government mandates.  The news was covered across the spectrum, but given less attention by U.S. media than domestic issues. Reports on all sides highlighted how people are upset that the government won't cover the cost of testing swabs, which unvaccinated people will need to use frequently to avoid fines. Right-rated outlets tended to offer more quotes from people protesting the mandate. Some coverage from left-rated sources framed anti-mandate protests in Italy as a product of conspiracy theories.

TITLE=> Texas Governor Signs 'Heartbeat Bill' Banning Abortion. ARTICLE=> Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill Wednesday banning abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat. The bill, passed by both chambers of the Republican-majority Texas legislature, prohibits abortion at six weeks of pregnancy without making an exception for rape or incest, though it does make an exception for medical emergencies. While approximately a dozen states have passed similar "heartbeat" bills, the Texas version absolves the state from enforcing the law and instead includes a provision that allows citizens to sue anyone they believe to be involved in helping a pregnant individual violate the ban. While the provision cannot be used against pregnant people, reproductive rights advocates warn it can be used against abortion providers and reproductive rights activists. The bill is expected to take effect in September. This comes after the Supreme Court announced Monday it would review a major abortion dispute that could roll back abortion protections under Roe v. Wade. Coverage across the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the bill. Some coverage from the center and left tended to frame the ban as "extreme" and highlight that at six weeks, Texas' bill has the earliest threshold for the ban, as many people are not aware they are pregnant by then. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight Abbott's remarks and the provision for private lawsuits.
TITLE=> Perspectives: International Women's Day. ARTICLE=> March 8 is International Women's Day, and March is Women's History Month, which is a time to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women throughout history. The holiday originated in 1911 when leader of the Women's Office for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, Clara Zetkin, suggested a celebration in every country on the same day for women to "press for their demands." According to the official International Women's Day website, the theme for 2021 is #ChooseToChallenge; the organizers encourage people to call out gender parity in government, workplaces, health care, sports and media coverage. In the past, International Women's Day was celebrated with community festivals, marathons and other events. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic this year, most events will be virtual. Media outlets across the political spectrum covered International Women's Day. Many voices in left-rated outlets advocated to push for gender equality, and highlighted women who broke boundaries throughout history. Some center- and right-rated outlets tended to detail the history of the holiday. Some right-rated voices focused on feminism's purported communist origins.

TITLE=> U.S. Job Growth Slows With 245,000 Jobs Added in November. ARTICLE=> U.S. job growth slowed significantly in November with 245,000 jobs created, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job growth is down from 610,000 in October and 711,000 in September. November’s unemployment rate was 6.7%, down from 6.9% in October. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Most coverage linked slowing job growth to the resurgence of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which has recently set records for daily deaths and hospitalizations. Coverage in some right-rated outlets described the numbers as a “disaster” and discussed relief negotiations in Congress. Coverage in some left-rated outlets discussed the idea of a “K-shaped” recovery and suggested that slow growth implied more permanent economic trends.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Handling of Immigration Questioned Across the Spectrum. ARTICLE=> Amid controversy surrounding the since-disbanded migrant camp in Texas and Border Patrol's treatment of the migrants, as well as the continued influx of unauthorized migrants at the southern border, President Joe Biden's handling of immigration has attracted criticism from all sides of the spectrum. According to Customs and Border Protection, 208,887 people were apprehended at the southern border in August. 50,014 were apprehended there in all of 2020. Some on the left have criticized Biden for continuing to use Title 42 of the Public Health Services Act to expel migrants; the law, which former President Donald Trump invoked at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, allows federal health officials to take extra measures to limit the transmission of a disease during a pandemic. Left-rated voices have often expressed concern that Biden is too hard on immigration, and that his willingness to deport asylum-seekers and opposition to more open borders too closely resemble Trump's immigration stance. Many right-rated voices have said Biden is too soft on immigration, arguing that he hasn't focused enough federal resources on curbing illegal immigration at the southern border. Some also condemned him for his criticism of Border Patrol agents that was based on misleading claims that agents whipping Haitian migrants. Many on the right also highlighted a recent interview of former President Barack Obama in which he criticized open borders.
TITLE=> Trump Looking to Ban TikTok After China Enforces Censorship Laws in Hong Kong. ARTICLE=> After China imposed internet censorship laws in Hong Kong last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the White House is looking into banning media applications from China, including popular video sharing application TikTok. Pompeo told Fox News that people should only download it “if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.” TikTok responded to Pompeo's comments Tuesday stating they had never shared any information with the Chinese government; in light of the new laws, TikTok's parent company ByteDance is looking to move its headquarters out of Hong Kong. Coverage from both the left and right noted that TikTok's switch comes amid escalating tensions over security and privacy between China and U.S. social media sites who refuse to hand over their Hong Kong user data. Some right-rated outlets said ByteDance "[showed] principle" by moving their headquarters and refusing to give over information.
TITLE=> Retail Traders Cause GameStop Stock to Surge.

TITLE=> Biden Formally Ends US Combat Mission in Iraq. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi announced an agreement on Monday to formally end the U.S. combat mission in Iraq by the end of the year. “I think things are going well. Our role in Iraq will be...to be available to continue to train, to assist, to help, and to deal with ISIS -- as it arrives. But we're not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission,” Biden said. Little will change on the ground, however, as the roughly 2,500 remaining U.S. troops in Iraq no longer regularly engage in combat and are likely to continue supporting Iraqi forces in an advisory capacity. Coverage was mostly similar across the spectrum, with several outlets calling the change “symbolic” and discussing the start of the Iraq War in 2003. Coverage in some left-rated outlets focused more on how the announcement was influenced by Iraqi domestic politics. Coverage in some right-rated outlets mentioned that former President Donald Trump lowered the number of U.S. troops in Iraq from 3,000 to 2,500. 
TITLE=> Perspectives: Amazon Removes Book About Transgender Issues. ARTICLE=> Amazon is under scrutiny for removing a book about transgender issues from its platforms. The book, "When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment," was published in 2018 and has at times spurred controversy for purportedly pushing transphobia. According to coverage from all sides of the spectrum, Amazon has declined multiple media requests to explain the removal as of Friday afternoon. Four Republican Senators sent the company a letter asking for an explanation and information about its content moderation policies. The story was highlighted by right-rated outlets, which framed the story as a glaring example of anti-conservative bias and unjust censorship by a powerful tech company. Several center-rated outlets covered the story, and only one left-rated outlet covered the story: the Britain-based Independent (Lean Left bias), which described the book as "attacking transgender people." Some coverage from right-rated sources focused on the fact that the book was once listed as a bestseller on Amazon and by the Washington Post. Fox News (Lean Right bias) analyzed the fact that the Post had not yet reported on the news; Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Post.

TITLE=> FDA Warns Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Linked to Risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. ARTICLE=> On Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning to the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine after data suggested the vaccine led to an increased risk of a disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome. The Washington Post reported that after 12.8 million people were inoculated, approximately 100 people developed the neurological condition, which causes the immune system to attack the nerves and sometimes has a paralyzing effect. The FDA said no data has shown a similar link between the disorder and the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. This comes after distribution of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was paused earlier this year after a link to blood clot development in younger recipients.  The story received coverage from across the spectrum.

Other reporting covered Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's reported hesitance to advance a new package.
TITLE=> Trump: COVID-19 Vaccine Developments Getting 'Political'. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said he might consider rejecting the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) new strict vaccine guidelines in a press conference Wednesday. In response to a question about the FDA's new guidelines at the press briefing, Trump said, "That sounds like a political move." The president has previously promised a vaccine before the end of the year, contradicting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield's estimate of spring or summer 2021. Trump's remarks come after Congress called on the U.S.' top health officials to testify, saying there was too much "political interference" in the agencies. Top health officials vowed in the hearing that a vaccine would not be approved until it met "vigorous expectations." Several vaccines are currently in the testing stage. The public health officials' congressional hearing was primarily covered by left- and center-rated outlets, while Trump's remarks were widely covered on all sides of the spectrum.

TITLE=> Senate Democrats Accuse NRA of Becoming Russian Asset. ARTICLE=> A report released Friday by Senate Democrats alleges that top National Rifle Association (NRA) officials knew of ties to Russian nationals, who are then accused of using the NRA to gain access to the American political system.

As of Friday afternoon, most right-leaning media sources have not reported the story.

TITLE=> The Golden City Finds Itself Less Golden; Debate Ignites Around Real-Life Virtues of Capitalism vs. Socialism. ARTICLE=> This week, the Washington Post published an article titled "How San Francisco Broke America's Heart," which brought up high costs of living and high rent as some reasons that so many residents of the Bay City are disgruntled. The author further blamed San Francisco's 'unbridled capitalism' clashing with progressive ideals for the lack of growth and opportunity for non-tech employers and employees- specifically citing teacher and social worker shortages across the city. The Blaze responded, essentially mocking the Washington Post article for the retaliation it received on social media platforms. The rebuke cites San Francisco's restrictive government and overbearing regulations for its housing qualms. CNBC cites a survey to predict where Tech companies are considering a move.

ARTICLE=> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to grant emergency use authorization of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to children as young as 12 by next week, the New York Times first reported Monday. If the FDA approves the decision, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) advisory panel will likely meet the day after to make recommendations for the shots’ use in teens. In March, Pfizer submitted data from a trial of nearly 2,300 adolescents between 12 and 15 years old, half of whom received the same two-shot regimen that has proven effective in adults. The trial's results suggested the two-shot vaccination process offered similar protection to adolescents as it does to adults. Vaccination approval for younger people is awaited by those who want to get students back to in-person school by the start of the new school year. The authorization could come by the end of the week.  The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum.

Qatari officials have reportedly been working with the Taliban to help restore normal operations at Kabul's airport. The planned departure made headlines across the spectrum. Some left- and center-rated sources focused on the passengers and their nationalities more generally; some right-rated sources placed more emphasis on the Americans who were making the flight.

Coverage from left- and center rated outlets tended to focus on Trump's criticism of the 1619 Project and critical race theory; some framed the 1776 Project as a "rewrite of history", and others framed it as "an appeal to white voters."

TITLE=> DHS Reportedly Withheld Intel on Russian Election Interference; Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> In July, the Department of Homeland Security reportedly withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin on Russian attempts to raise doubts over the health of U.S. 2020 presidential candidates. A DHS spokesperson later said the bulletin, titled " Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election," was withheld because it "lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination." The bulletin cites posts by Russian proxy websites and state media outlets concerning former Vice President Joe Biden’s mental health, as well as some Chinese and Iranian state media coverage on President Donald Trump’s mental health. The DHS bulletin received coverage in many left-rated outlets and few major right-rated outlets; Newsmax and Fox News were the only major right-rated outlets to post original content on the story as of time of posting.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Kamala Harris Criticized for Handling of Immigration. ARTICLE=> Vice President Kamala Harris received criticism from fellow Democrats and human rights groups after she told potential migrants "do not come" at a press conference with the president of Guatemala during her first international trip since taking office. On Tuesday, when NBC's Lester Holt asked Harris, who was tasked by President Joe Biden with handling immigration, why she hasn't visited the border yet, Harris said, "At some point, you know, we are going to the border," Harris. "We've been to the border." When Holt replied that she hadn't been to the border, the vice president said, "and I haven't been to Europe...I don't understand the point that you're making...I'm not discounting the importance of the border." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted Monday, "First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival. Second...We can’t help set someone’s house on fire and then blame them for fleeing." Harris has said that she will tackle the flow of migrants at the border by addressing the "root causes" in Central American countries, such as lack of economic opportunity.  Voices from the right tended to contrast Harris' recent remarks with her past stances on immigration during her presidential campaign, and highlighted criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Some left- and center-analysts suggest that Harris is playing to voters by taking a centrist approach with her attempt to quell traffic at the border. Some left-rated outlets also highlighted quotes from asylum seekers.

Senate Republicans prepared to use a filibuster to block the vote, which would move the bill past formal debate, on Tuesday. While Schumer said the deadline was merely to “get the ball rolling,” Republicans described it at more than that, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) accusing Schumer of “trying to blow this effort up.” Senate negotiators reportedly had roughly a dozen disagreements still to work out on Tuesday, mostly surrounding how to pay for the bill. Democrats hope to make progress on the infrastructure bill, as well as their proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, before the August recess. Coverage was most prominent in left- and center-rated outlets, as well as in outlets focusing on Washington, D.C. politics.

The New York Post (Lean Right bias) first reported the admission; DeRosa released a statement Friday saying Cuomo's administration was "comprehensive and transparent in our responses" to the Justice Department after it sent Democrat governors a letter inquiring about nursing home fatalities on Aug. 26. Outlets on all sides covered the news, with many right-rated outlets featuring it prominently. Many across the spectrum also reported on calls from New York Democrats to limit Cuomo's emergency powers. Some headlines from left- and center-rated sources painted the news as "allegations" against Cuomo; headlines from right-rated outlets tended to highlight DeRosa's admission itself. Many reports form right-rated sources framed the situation as a large-scale cover-up. Some voices criticized Cuomo and left-leaning media outlets for purportedly enabling the cover-up.

TITLE=> Biden Fields Criticism on Border Crisis From GOP, Arizona Dems. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden's handling of ongoing immigration issues at the Mexico-U.S. border prompted criticism from both sides of the aisle this week. Former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence accused the Biden administration of encouraging "open borders" and ignoring a historic surge in unauthorized immigrants. Biden said in an interview this week that the Trump administration failed to participate in "a real transition," thus exacerbating the immigration issue. Arizona Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema also both called on Biden this week to define a better plan for dealing with the border crisis. Preliminary April data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as reported by the Washington Post, says unauthorized crossings at the southern border are reportedly hovering near a 20-year high.

Block cited a similar Supreme Court ruling from June that involved transgender job discrimination as evidence that this other regulation could be invalid. Coverage of this story was generally consistent across left- and center-rated outlets; as of Tuesday afternoon, there was little coverage of this story from right-rated outlets.

Perot famously dropped out during the summer of the 1992 election, only to re-enter in October and win 19% of the popular vote. Debate still ensues as to whether Perot cost George H.W.

Left-leaning media focused on the many factors that DHS has added during Donald Trump's presidency and how those rules seemingly target Hispanic migrants. Some right-leaning media reported on the rule as fair and not necessarily harsh.
TITLE=> House GOP Elects Elise Stefanik to Replace Liz Cheney. ARTICLE=> Two days after they voted to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as GOP Conference Chair,  House Republicans elected Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) to fill the position.

Stefanik was challenged for the role by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who opposed Stefanik’s “moderate” positions and gained 46 votes against Stefanik’s 134. In a statement posted to Twitter, Stefanik said, “House Republicans are united in our focus to fight on behalf of the American people to save our country from the radical Socialist Democrat agenda of President Biden and Nancy Pelosi.” Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to contain analysis of what Stefanik’s role would mean for the Republican party moving forward. Some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted quotes from Republican leaders congratulating Stefanik.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Safety and Practicality of COVID-19 Vaccine Development. ARTICLE=> Two COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine development trials, from healthcare firms Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, have been paused in recent days due to reported adverse reactions among test subjects. Both development processes were in the final stages; such pauses are reportedly common in large-scale medical trials and studies. The news was accompanied by opinions expressed on each side about the coronavirus vaccine development process, the dire nature of the pandemic, and the politicization of the overall situation. Some voices on the left expressed skepticism about the apparently rapid process, urging caution and criticizing the president for allegedly weaponizing health and science for political purposes. Tuesday morning, Republicans Reps. Brett Guthrie (Ky.) and Larry Bucshon (Ind.) penned an op-ed in The Hill highlighting how vaccine developers and the Trump administration are purportedly working in close partnership to adhere to safety and minimize risks while producing a viable vaccine as fast as possible.

ARTICLE=> On Thursday, White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki said the Biden administration is working with Facebook to flag posts that "spread disinformation" about COVID-19 vaccines; Psaki also said the White House asked Facebook to share the reach and engagement numbers for flagged posts. Psaki cited a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which said 12 people were responsible for almost 65% of false vaccine information on social media, and called on platforms to remove the accounts; Facebook has reportedly disputed this methodology, according to Reuters. This comes as U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday that "health misinformation is a serious threat to public health."  Some left-rated outlets led with Murthy's comments in their headlines, and focused on the reported number of posts containing false vaccine information. Some right-rated outlets highlighted criticism of the White House's decision; others on the right pointed out that Facebook was among the social media platforms to prematurely flag posts about the Wuhan lab leak theory.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Sanders's Endorsement of Joe Biden. ARTICLE=> Senator Bernie Sanders's endorsement of former Vice President and rival Joe Biden (DE) for president has prompted wide-scale speculation, primarily about Biden's ability to win over progressives and incorporate some of Sanders's policies into his own White House plan. Reporting outlets generally analyzed Biden's prospective abilities to win over progressive voters; right-rated sources tended to cast doubt on Biden's chances of defeating incumbent President Donald Trump in November, focusing specifically on factions of Sanders's following and other left-leaning sectors that have so far rejected Biden.
TITLE=> Senate Report Says 'No Evidence' to Support Sexual Assault Allegations Against Kavanaugh. ARTICLE=> Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report on Saturday that says they found "no evidence" to support the allegations of sexual assault made against Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings.
TITLE=> Trump Social Media Accounts Banned 'Indefinitely'. ARTICLE=> Facebook said Thursday that President Donald Trump's accounts will be banned from the platform and from Instagram "indefinitely," or at least until the end of his term. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement, "we believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great." This comes after Twitter, Facebook and Youtube enacted a 24-hour ban on the president's accounts after concerns his posts were spreading false election fraud claims and inciting violence. Twitch and Snapchat have also joined the social media platforms who have banned Trump's accounts 'indefinitely.' Some voices from the left, including former First Lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Mark R. Warner, D-Va., criticized Facebook and other Big Tech companies for not banning Trump sooner. Some voices from the right, including Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, tended to frame Facebook's ban as "censorship" of Trump, also painting the restrictions as a show of tech companies' power and sovereignty over the sharing of ideas and information.
TITLE=> National Debt Tops $22 Trillion for First Time. ARTICLE=> The national debt topped $22 trillion for the first time on Tuesday, with many experts warning that, if the current trend continues, it will have dire consequences for Americans.
TITLE=> Jobless Claims Topped 1 Million Last Week. ARTICLE=> Approximately 1.106 million people filed for initial jobless claims last week, according to data from the Department of Labor. This rise comes after two weeks of declining numbers, in which the number of initial jobless claims fell below 1 million. Coverage from some left-rated outlets suggested that the rise in jobless claims is a result of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and other pandemic benefits expiring. Some right-rated outlets suggested the increase could be a result of more people applying for jobless benefits after President Donald Trump recently added $300 in extra federal payouts.
TITLE=> Serena Williams' Treatment at U.S. Open Sparks Debate Over Sexism in Tennis. ARTICLE=> Serena Williams on Saturday lost the U.S. Open final to Naomi Osaka after a series of tense exchanges with the umpire who penalized her for breaking her racket, allegedly receiving mid-match coaching, and calling him a "thief." Some say that the code violations she received were overly harsh and sexist, while others argue that Williams broke the rules and that Osaka is the rightful winner.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Republicans Call for Unity Amid Trump’s Second Impeachment. ARTICLE=> As House Democrats and some Republicans called for impeaching President Donald Trump for “incitement of insurrection,” several Republican leaders called for “unity” and argued that impeachment would be “divisive.” This led to a broad discourse over the idea of unity among media figures. Polls show that a slight majority of Americans supported impeachment between Jan. 6 and Jan. 13, including 85% support from Democrats, 48% support from Independents and 15% support from Republicans. However, with 10 House Republicans’ support, Wednesday’s vote was the most bipartisan impeachment in U.S. history. Voices in left-rated outlets tended to criticize Republicans’ calls for unity and label Trump’s actions as divisive. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to frame Democrats’ support for impeachment as divisive. Voices from both sides accused the other of hypocrisy.
TITLE=> Biden Signs Executive Order to Strengthen U.S. Cybersecurity, Colonial Pipeline to Launch Restart. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at improving U.S. cybersecurity and defenses after a ransomware hack caused the Colonial Pipeline, which provides nearly half of the transportation fuel for the East Coast, to shut down. The order, which the White House had been working on for months, will establish a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board to review incidents in multiple agencies, and mandates that federal systems log cybersecurity incidents and use stronger encryption and authentication methods. Also on Wednesday, the Colonial Pipeline announced it will restart operations after a six-day shutdown, though the company warns that the restarting process will take several days. The story received coverage across the political spectrum. Outlets from the right and center tended to focus on the details of the executive order; some outlets on the left tended to focus on the several cybersecurity incidents Biden has had to respond to, including a Russian cyberespionage operation and Chinese cyberhacking campaign.
TITLE=> Intel Chief Surprised By Putin Invite to DC. ARTICLE=> Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was surprised to hear that President Trump has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to come to Washington in the Fall.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Obama's 'Defund the Police' Remarks. ARTICLE=> Former President Barack Obama said in an interview Wednesday that political candidates who use "snappy slogans" such as "defund the police" risk alienating their base and jeopardizing their campaign goals on police reform. "Do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?" Obama said,  arguing that Republicans used the slogan against Democrats during the election, causing Democrats to lose seats in the House. Democrat leaders including House Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) echoed Obama's remarks. Progressive leaders such as projected House election winners Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) argued that messages like “defund the police” have been effective. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to emphasize the pushback Obama's remarks received from progressive leaders. Some reports from left-rated outlets highlighted Democrats who agreed with Obama's position, and some analyzed Obama's history on criminal justice policy.
TITLE=> Trump Addresses Nation About Iran Conflict. ARTICLE=> In a televised address to the nation Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump conveyed his stance that the recently reignited conflict with Iran will subside. This comes after the Iranian military launched missiles on two Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops Tuesday night.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Supreme Court and Trump's Tax Returns. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court heard arguments this week on whether or not President Donald Trump can bar his banks and accounting firms from releasing tax returns and financial documents associated with his businesses and holdings. The deliberations — on which a decision is expected next month — have resurrected debate about public officials disclosing finances, personal privacy, Trump's financial status and government corruption. The story has been covered more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets. Some left-rated voices questioned whether or not the president has something to hide, and criticized his purported efforts to rise "above the law."
TITLE=> First Weekly Increase in Jobless Claims Since March. ARTICLE=> Roughly 1.4 million polled filed new unemployment claims last week, the first rise in jobless claims since March. Many experts attribute the rise to economic uncertainty amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Right- and left-rated outlets tended to report uniformly on the news. Some polls suggest the general public is concerned about the job market's ability to fully recover.

ARTICLE=> Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairperson Ronna Romney McDaniel said Tuesday the RNC may advise future Republican presidential candidates to skip debates hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), which has hosted all general election presidential debates since 1988, unless the CPD makes "significant reforms." In a letter to the CPD, McDaniel stated, "The CPD's repeated missteps and the partisan actions of its Board Members make clear that the organization no longer provides the fair and impartial forum for presidential debates which the law requires and the American people deserve." The letter comes after Trump repeatedly criticized the CPD for its format and moderators during the 2020 presidential election. McDaniel has requested a response from the CPD by the end of July.  Outlets from across the spectrum tended to highlight McDaniel's criticisms and Trump's allegations of bias. 
TITLE=> AOC Gives First Endorsement to Moderate Dem's Challenger. ARTICLE=> Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Marie Newman, a progressive challenging a Democratic state representative in Illinois' Third Congressional District, on Tuesday. Newman has picked up other endorsements from senators Bernie Sanders (I -VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), and is challenging Dan Lipinski, who's considered more moderate and is one of the only pro-life Democrats in Congress. He has served eight terms, most recently beating Newman by a slim margin in 2018.
TITLE=> Pfizer Requests FDA Vaccine Authorization for Children 5 to 11. ARTICLE=> Pfizer and BioNTech announced Thursday that they had formally requested FDA emergency use authorization of their COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. The request comes roughly three weeks after Pfizer said a lower vaccine dose had proven safe and effective in clinical trials for that age group. The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its advisory board for Oct. 26 to consider the authorization. About 125 of the 28 million American children aged 5 to 11 have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations among Americans under 18 rose sharply over the summer, from 0.3 per 100,000 in June to 1.4 per 100,000 in August.  Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum. Coverage on all sides differed on attributing the authorization request to Pfizer alone or to both Pfizer and BioNTech.
TITLE=> Puerto Ricans Protest Amidst 'Chatgate'. ARTICLE=> Protesters in Puerto Rico have gathered in large numbers and blocked a highway, calling for the resignation of their governor Ricardo Rosselló. Rosselló has been caught up in 'chatgate,' a texting scandal in which he and members of his administration were found to exchange messages using derogatory language towards women, victims of Hurricane Maria, and people with disabilities. Rosselló has since stepped down as his party's leader and will not seek reelection, but refuses to step down. Both left-leaning and right-leaning media have reported similarly on the subject, as the protests are still developing.
TITLE=> Biden Says US Will Have Enough Vaccines for All Adults by End of May. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the U.S. will have enough coronavirus vaccines for all adults by the end of May, two months sooner than his previous prediction. The revised estimate comes amid accelerated manufacturing efforts around Johnson & Johnson's newly approved single-shot vaccine, which Biden said rival pharmaceutical company Merck is helping produce under the Defense Production Act. The president also described a new initiative to vaccinate more teachers in a push to reopen schools. The news was covered across the spectrum with similar headlines and narratives, but was featured more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets, some of which highlighted the fact that public reluctance and issues with distribution could cause vaccination efforts to extend into the summer. Sources on all sides also placed the news in the context of the push from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to end pandemic lockdowns and mask mandates in the state. Some right-rated outlets focused specifically on the efforts to vaccinate teachers, and framed Biden's conduct on school reopenings in a negative light.
TITLE=> Perspectives: ABC Reporter Suspended After Project Veritas Sting. ARTICLE=> ABC News suspended veteran political reporter David Wright Wednesday after he was recorded stating political opinions and criticisms of ABC in undercover video shot by media watchdog Project Veritas. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused more on Wright's comments about President Trump and apparent criticisms of his employer's journalistic integrity; some left-rated outlets framed Wright's suspension as being due to his criticisms of ABC rather than a product of him supposedly revealing his bias. Some left-leaning voices and opinions admonished ABC for succumbing to Project Veritas' purportedly unethical measures of reporting.
TITLE=> Reaction to Harris Dropping Out of 2020 Race. ARTICLE=> Reactions to Senator Kamala Harris (D - CA) rescinding her bid for the White House differed across the political spectrum.

TITLE=> Winter Storms Hit Communities Across the Country, Leaving Millions in Texas Without Power. ARTICLE=> High winds, cold temperatures and snowstorms hit cities across the U.S. on Sunday, leaving over 150 million people under winter weather advisories and over two million Texans without power. President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Texas, as icy conditions led to several pileups on roads in the region. Additionally, Seattle saw its snowiest day in decades, and parts of Minnesota saw temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees. The storms were predicted by meteorologists and climatologists, who for years had noted that a weakened “jet stream” of warm air allowed cold air from the Arctic’s “polar vortex” to dip to lower latitudes during the winter months. Coverage in right-rated outlets and some left-rated outlets focused primarily on Texas and Oklahoma; other coverage in left-rated outlets described the cold weather as “coast-to-coast.” Coverage in some left-rated outlets also addressed the role of climate change in causing the storms.
TITLE=> Top Philadelphia Inquirer Editor Resigns After Controversy Over "Buildings Matter, Too" Headline. ARTICLE=> The Philadelphia Inquirer's executive editor resigned this week following controversy over a recent column published by the paper. Initially titled "Buildings Matter, Too," the article decried property damage in the wake of protests and riots. The paper apologized after running the headline, and changed it to "Damaging buildings disproportionately hurts the people protesters are trying to uplift." Reports from left-rated outlets focused on the backlash from the Inquirer's own journalists. Coverage from right-rated outlets framed Wischnowski's departure as an example of media outlets supposedly allowing critical feedback to dictate their content, following a similar controversy last week regarding the New York Times and an op-ed from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton that led to the Times' head opinion page editor resigning.
TITLE=> Mueller Accused of Illegally Obtaining Trump Emails. ARTICLE=> A lawyer in President Trump's transition team is accusing Special Counsel Robert Mueller of obtaining tens of thousands of emails unlawfully, which he received from the General Services Administration as part of the Russia probe.

TITLE=> CNN Airs Recordings of Melania Trump Discussing Child Separation Criticism. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, CNN aired a secretly-recorded conversation between First Lady Melania Trump and a former friend from 2018. In the recordings, Melania complained about critics of the Trump administration’s child separation policy and said some migrants are trained to lie about gang violence to get asylum. Melania was also displeased with the “liberal media’s” alleged refusal to cover her attempts to reunite a separated family. Additionally, Melania discussed her stress from planning the White House’s Christmas decorations: “I'm working...my [expletive] off on the Christmas stuff, that you know, who gives a [expletive] about the Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?” Coverage in some left-rated outlets described Melania’s comments as “profane,” saying she “downplayed” border conditions and “took aim” at migrant children and critics. Coverage in some right-rated outlets criticized left-rated outlets’ coverage and conveyed more favorable views of the First Lady. Coverage in some right-rated outlets also used sensationalist language, such as “trashed” and “lashing out.”

ARTICLE=> Electors met in every state on Monday to formally elect the next president of the United States. Joe Biden is the state-certified winner of the 2020 presidential election, and electors are widely expected to hand him a definitive victory. Trump adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News Monday that the Trump campaign would submit the votes of an “alternate slate of electors” to Congress, extending President Donald Trump’s bid to reverse the state-certified election results. Outlets on all sides featured relatively balanced previews and live coverage of the Electoral College vote. Some coverage from across the spectrum said the electors would “affirm Biden’s victory,” and some said only that it would “cast ballots for U.S. president.” Coverage of Miller’s comments came mostly from center- and left-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Administration Officials and Democratic Leadership Meet To Discuss Coronavirus Relief Package. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss the next coronavirus spending package.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Liberty University President Resigns Amid Alleged Sex Scandal. ARTICLE=> Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. announced his resignation Tuesday. Falwell has garnered criticism for his role in an alleged sex scandal first reported this week by Reuters; he is a prominent figure in American religious conservatism, and took over as head of Liberty, an evangelical school, in 2007. The story has been covered by outlets on all sides of the spectrum, with more coverage coming from left- and center-rated outlets. Voices throughout the spectrum have been critical of Falwell's alleged sexual conduct and overall behavior as Liberty president. Some right-rated voices were especially critical of the alleged polygamy Falwell and his wife participated in, contrasting it with Falwell's self-expressed Christianity. At least one left-rated voice also focused on the purported non-monogamy, criticizing the ostensible social normality of monogamous relationships.
TITLE=> Trump to Give First State of the Union. ARTICLE=> President Trump will deliver his first State of the Union address on Tuesday where he will outline the economic benefits of the tax cuts and will present his plans for immigration, infrastructure, and trade.

Gomez was elected by fellow members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Tuesday to lead the organization. Gomez, who served as the group's vice president for three years, is the first UCCB president of Hispanic descent. Some left-leaning outlets framed Gomez's election as a gesture aimed at President Trump and his stances on immigration, as Gomez is a vocal advocate for migrant rights.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Support Builds for Banning 'No-Knock' Police Warrants. ARTICLE=> Lawmakers from both political parties have signaled support for a nationwide ban on "no-knock" police warrants, a controversial tactic that led to the tragic police killing of Kentucky woman Breonna Taylor in March. Louisville passed a similar no-knock bill into law this week. Republican Sen. Rand Paul (KY) introduced the "Justice for Breonna Taylor Act" Thursday night, which would ban the warrants for federal agents and any state or local police departments receiving Justice Department funding; Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is reportedly drafting a similar proposal. Congressional Democrats unveiled a police reform bill earlier this week that would ban no-knock warrants in federal drug cases.
TITLE=> AG Barr Says His Job Made 'Impossible' by President Trump's Tweets. ARTICLE=> Attorney General William Barr's criticisms of the president's social media use have been covered similarly on all sides of the media spectrum. Barr said in an interview with ABC News Thursday that Trump's tweets make it "impossible" for him to effectively fill his role at the Department of Justice. The department announced earlier this week it would reduce its originally recommended prison sentence for former Trump adviser Roger Stone, a move that drew praise from the president on Twitter while prompting criticism and accusations of political interference between the White House and the DOJ from others.
TITLE=> Wall Street Trade Temporarily Halted as S&P Drops 7% at Opening. ARTICLE=> Trading on the U.S. stock exchanges was halted briefly after opening on Monday, as the S&P 500 fell 7% due in part to fallout from the coronavirus and global sparring over oil prices.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Media Bias and Ivermectin Misinformation. ARTICLE=> A viral story about Oklahoma hospitals overflowing with people who'd overdosed on horse dewormer turned out to be misleading, but not until several major news sources had elevated the misinformation. The claim that emergency rooms were backed up with overdosing patients, which originally came from a rural Oklahoma doctor, has since been disputed by one Oklahoma hospital and has not been confirmed or supported by any other source. Rolling Stone (Left bias), MSNBC (Left), The Guardian (Lean Left) and Newsweek (Center) were among the major mainstream outlets to report the misleading story, with Rolling Stone adding a lengthy update at the top of its original article.  Voices across the spectrum, particularly on the right but also elsewhere, criticized mainstream media's handling of the story and of COVID-19 stories in general. Some voices speculated that because the source's account likely confirmed journalists' preconceived notions about rural Americans' attitudes toward COVID-19, they didn't spend as much time vetting the claims. 
TITLE=> New York Times Writer Resigns, Cites Media Bias and Hostile Work Environment. ARTICLE=> Bari Weiss, a writer and editor for the New York Times' opinion desk, published a resignation letter Monday, citing media bias and a "hostile work environment." Weiss wrote in her letter that she was hired to diversify the New York Times' opinion section, which is rated Left by AllSides, by bringing in first-time writers, centrists, conservatives and "others who would not naturally think of the Times as their home." Instead, Weiss wrote she found that "a new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper: that truth isn’t a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else." Weiss' letter was embraced by several prominent voices from the right, including Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr., and Ben Shapiro; prominent voice from the left, Bill Maher, also expressed support for Weiss. When it comes to wording, some left-rated outlets framed Weiss as a "controversial" opinion writer in their headlines. Several liberal journalists criticized Weiss' letter, including Linda Tirado, a freelance photojournalist who lost her eye to a rubber bullet in May while covering the street protests in Minneapolis. Tirado contrasted Weiss' concerns about press freedoms to physical attacks on the press in a tweet.
TITLE=> Veritas Reveals Clinton DNC Incite Violence. ARTICLE=> Project Veritas Action has released the second video in a multi-part series that is sending shockwaves through the DNC and the Clinton campaign.

TITLE=> Pompeo Claims "Pretty Clear" Russia Behind Cyberattack, Trump Says "May" Be China. ARTICLE=> On Saturday, President Donald Trump said China "may" have been behind a wide series of cyberattacks on the U.S. government, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged on Friday that the attack was done by Russia. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said Thursday the hack compromised federal agencies and "critical infrastructure." Pompeo was the first government official to tie the hack to Russia. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump claimed that the hack was "under control" and exaggerated by the "Fake News Media." Trump also said that China "may" be to blame for the hack, and that "there could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election." Coverage from center- and right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the attack and on Pompeo's interview. Some left-rated outlets tended to focus on criticism of Trump's response.
TITLE=> Russia Claims it Blocked Romney from Becoming Secretary of State. ARTICLE=> Russia claims that it stopped Mitt Romney from becoming Secretary of State so that President Trump would select someone who would remove "Ukraine-related" sanctions.
TITLE=> Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) Suspended By YouTube Over COVID-19 Mask Claims. ARTICLE=> YouTube suspended Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for seven days on Tuesday night over a video where he claimed that cloth masks are ineffective against COVID-19. Paul said in the video that "most of the masks you get over the counter don’t work," but added that he has "always said" that N-95 masks work. The senator then pointed to how Dr. Fauci "knew that too," but originally "lied to the public" about N-95 masks being ineffective against COVID-19 so that enough health workers could buy them. "He justified his lies by explaining that he was trying to shape human behavior," Paul continued. The three-minute clip ended with Paul labeling YouTube's censorship as "very dangerous," adding that it can "stifle debate and promotes group think where the truth is defined by people with a political agenda." A YouTube spokesperson told The Hill that they removed the senator's video because it violated their COVID-19 medical misinformation policy. The platform previously removed an eight-minute Newsmax interview from his channel where he said “there’s no value” in wearing masks. In other censorship news, Twitter suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for a week after claiming that COVID-19 vaccines are “failing.” Right-leaning outlets were more likely to emphasize Paul's apprehension about the effectiveness of cloth masks specifically. On the other hand, left-leaning outlets were more likely to reiterate that the CDC and "countless" public health experts said that face masks can prevent the spread of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. UNSW Sydney, one of the two publications that Paul cited, released a study in 2020 that said cloth masks can be protective against infection but must be washed daily at high temperatures to be effective. 
TITLE=> AG Barr Has No Plan To Appoint Special Counsel on Hunter Biden, Election Fraud. ARTICLE=> Attorney General William Barr said on Monday that there was no need to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden’s finances or claims of election fraud. “I have not seen a reason to appoint a special counsel and I have no plan to do so before I leave,” Barr said. Hunter Biden’s taxes and business dealings are currently being investigated by the IRS and the FBI. President Donald Trump announced on Dec. 14 that Barr would step down the following week. Barr’s remarks came at a press conference announcing charges against a man involved in the 1988 Lockerbie flight bombing. Barr also said he agreed with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “it certainly appears” that Russia was behind the SolarWinds cyberattack. Coverage in some left-rated outlets framed Barr’s remarks as a rebuke of Trump and his election fraud narrative. Some reports from right-rated outlets focused on the Hunter Biden investigation and said Barr “rejected” special counsels.

Since knowledge of the incident has become widespread, people on both the Right and Left have responded by rating the restaurant on Yelp and Facebook.
TITLE=> North Korea and South Korea Test Missiles. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, North Korea and South Korea tested ballistic missiles in an apparent display of military might that may exacerbate tensions between the rival countries. North Korea fired two ballistic missiles across its east coast, while South Korea tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile. No aircraft or ships were damaged by the missile launches. The launches, a breach of U.N. resolutions, occurred as talks aimed at stripping North Korea of its nuclear program are stalled. Some reports noted that the launches show how North Korea, despite a severe economic crisis, has continued to develop weapons.
TITLE=> White House Defends Soleimani Killing In New Memo, Leaves Some Skeptical. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's administration released a report last week outlining its legal justification for killing top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in January, saying the move came “in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months." The administration had previously claimed that an "imminent threat" had prompted the strike. Outlets on the left and center highlighted the conflicting nature of the memo, noting that it contained no evidence of an imminent threat. Right-leaning coverage was more sparse, though some publications did carry Trump's response to the administration's explanations, in which he called them "totally consistent."
TITLE=> N.Y., N.J. Sign Laws to Let Undocumented Immigrants Apply for Driver's Licenses. ARTICLE=> A so-called "Green Light Law" allowing people who are in the country illegally to obtain driver's licenses took effect in New York state this week, and New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed a similar state law into effect Thursday. The N.Y. law also bars federal immigration and border officials from accessing the state's DMV database; the two states are the 14th and 15th to pass such laws. Differences in coverage were most apparent in certain terminology used. Left and center-rated outlets generally labeled those in the country illegally as "undocumented immigrants," while right-rated outlets more frequently described them as "illegal immigrants"; a persistent contrast in how the media covers immigration in the United States.
TITLE=> DHS Informs States About Hacking. ARTICLE=> On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) informed 21 states that they were targeted by Russian hackers during the 2016 election. The DHS did not disclose to the media which states were targeted, but Reuters reports that Wisconsin, Ohio, California, and 10 others have confirmed that they were targeted.

TITLE=> G-7 Leaders Call For Investigation Into COVID-19 Origins. ARTICLE=> The leaders of the G-7 nations released a joint statement Sunday calling for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the G-7 Summit came to a close Sunday, President Joe Biden, along with the leaders of the U.K., Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and France, called on the World Health Organization (WHO) to lead "a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study" in China. This comes after Biden urged the other leaders to call out China’s nonmarket policies and human rights violations; in the statement, the G-7 said it would challenge "non-market policies...which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy” and called on China to "respect human rights and fundamental freedoms" in Xinjiang. The leaders of the G-7 nations also pledged to deliver 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to countries in need within one year; committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050; and agreed on a 15% minimum tax on multinational companies.  Outlets from across the spectrum focused on the details of the G-7 leaders' statement. 
TITLE=> US, NATO and EU Blame China-Affiliated Hackers for Microsoft Hack. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration joined a broad group of U.S. allies in formally blaming a hacking group tied to China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), known as “Hafnium,” for a breach of Microsoft’s Exchange Server email software earlier this year. Microsoft itself blamed the group in March, labeling it a “state-sponsored threat actor,” but governments held off blame until investigators had “high confidence” that the group was affiliated with the MSS. Additionally, the Justice Department indicted three MSS officers and one contracted hacker on separate hacking charges. The White House said in a statement that the U.S. had raised the issue with the Chinese government, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said in a press release that “the United States will impose consequences on PRC malicious cyber actors for their irresponsible behavior in cyberspace." No sanctions have been issued as of Monday afternoon. Coverage differed across the spectrum in saying the U.S. had accused either the Chinese government itself or just “Chinese-linked hackers"; statements by NATO, the European Union, Canada and the U.K. also varied somewhat on that point. While most coverage focused on the Microsoft hack, some coverage focused on the broader accusations of criminal hacking activity, including ransomware attacks, made against MSS-affiliated hackers.

TITLE=> AOC: Manafort Should Not be Held in Solitary Confinement. ARTICLE=> Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez denounces the possible solitary confinement of former Trump operative, Paul Manafort, on Wednesday. Manafort would be held in solitary confinement at the infamous Riker's Island, awaiting trial on charges brought on by the state of New York. Manafort is being held in prison for tax and bank fraud from last August, and is expected to be arraigned later this month in the State of New York. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has also spoken out against the solitary confinement that Chelsea Manning faced, because Manning did not participate in Grand Jury testimony. All of this started as a response to a New York Times article.
TITLE=> House Will Hold Full Vote on Impeachment Inquiry. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will hear a resolution this week "that affirms the ongoing, existing" impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump in a press release Monday. The resolution will reportedly be released Wednesday with the full House planning to vote on Thursday, according to sources cited by NPR. It will be the first time the entire House formally votes in relation to the proceedings. President Trump has not yet publicly commented on Pelosi's statement.
TITLE=> US Birth Rate Fell to 42-Year Low in 2020. ARTICLE=> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of births fell 4% in 2020 from the previous year, hitting the lowest point since 1979. The news follows a downward birthrate trend in recent years that was likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC reported 3,605,201 births in 2020, down from 3,747,540 during the year prior; according to this report, 2020 is the sixth consecutive year the number of births in the U.S. has fallen. The general fertility rate also fell to a record low in 2020, dropping to 55.8 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, down 4% from 2019. Left- and right-rated outlets covered the news very similarly, often highlighting it on their websites Wednesday and citing some of the same studies and data. Sources throughout the spectrum focused on the pandemic's role in the declining birthrate, and that fact that most female age groups experienced a drop-off in births during 2020.
TITLE=> ICE Targets Student Visa Fraud With Fake Michigan University. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has arrested hundreds of foreign-born students after setting up a fake university in Michigan as part of an elaborate visa fraud sting. As first reported by the Detroit Free Press, around 250 individuals, most of them Indian, have been detained and/or deported since January after seeking student visas from the school, dubbed the University of Farmington. The sting, which was first reported early this year, has been met with harsh criticism from figures on the left, many of whom have tried to link it to President Donald Trump's immigration policy. But right-leaning voices have noted that, in fact, the ICE operation began under the administration of former President Barack Obama, which set up a similarly fictitious university in New Jersey in 2013.
TITLE=> Twitter Bans Political Advertisements. ARTICLE=> Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday that the platform would ban political ads globally, saying political messages earn "reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money." Many reporting outlets are focusing on Facebook's recent refusal to make a similar move. Some are framing the news as a loss, both for underrepresented political groups and free speech rights.
TITLE=> Equifax Agrees To Pay Up To $700 Million In Settlement For Data Breach. ARTICLE=> Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency with over 800 million customers worldwide, will pay up to $700 million to settle claims that they did not sufficiently secure their networks. As a result, hundreds of millions of names, dates of birth and social security numbers were subjected to hackers.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's $1.8 Trillion 'American Families Plan'. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration on Wednesday unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal, titled the “American Families Plan,” which would invest in education, childcare and paid leave while raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. President Joe Biden is expected to formally announce the proposal during his first joint address to Congress Wednesday evening. Specific provisions of the plan include universal pre-school, two years of free community college, direct financial support to families, a national paid family and medical leave program, and extended tax breaks, including the child tax credit increase from Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The plan would also return the top income tax bracket rate to the pre-2017 level of 39.6% and apply that rate to capital gains for households making over $1 million.  Some voices from across the spectrum focused on the larger context of Biden's other large spending bills. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to criticize Biden's high spending and tax hikes, particularly the capital gains tax. Voices in some left-rated outlets addressed the plan's impact on families and pointed to proposals that were not included in the families plan.
TITLE=> Wayne County GOP Members Want to Rescind Votes Certifying Presidential Election. ARTICLE=> The two Republicans on Michigan's Wayne County Board of Canvassers signed affidavits on Wednesday saying they want to rescind their votes that certified the county's election results. Both Monica Palmer and William Hartmann said they were subjected to threats for raising concerns that absentee ballot books did not match the number of ballots cast in the Detroit area. The Board's vice chairman says the board members can't change their votes after the fact. The affidavits are the latest development in ongoing legal and other disputes over Michigan's election results.
TITLE=> Gorsuch Breaks From Conservatives, Joins Liberals in Majority Opinion. ARTICLE=> On Monday morning, Neil Gorsuch, the first Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, broke with his fellow conservative justices to join an opinion. Herrera v. Wyoming was decided today in favor of the petitioner, who argued that a century-and-a-half old contract between the United States government and the Crow Tribe, of which he was a member, allowed him to hunt outside of any time restraints set by the State of Wyoming. The State of Wyoming argued that any contract between the United States government and the Crow Tribe became null and void when Wyoming attained statehood. The Supreme Court overturned the rulings of the lower courts, which ruled in favor of the State of Wyoming, and lead to Herrera's conviction for off-season hunting.
TITLE=> Pelosi Says Jan. 6 Committee Will Continue Despite GOP 'Antics'. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the House select committee on the January 6th Capitol riot would continue despite House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s pledge that Republicans would not participate in a “sham committee.” “It is my responsibility as the speaker of the House to make sure we get to the truth of this, and we will not let their antics stand in the way of that,” Pelosi said in a news conference. The comments come a day after McCarthy pulled GOP nominees to the committee in retaliation for Pelosi’s rejection of Reps. Jim Banks and Jim Jordan. Rep. Liz Cheney, who is now the sole Republican appointed to the committee, also criticized McCarthy on Thursday, saying that his “playing politics” was “disgraceful.” Pelosi is reportedly considering appointing Republican Trump critic Rep. Adam Kinzinger to the committee. Most headlines across the spectrum focused on Pelosi’s “antics” quote. Some coverage in left- and center-rated outlets focused on Pelosi’s reasoning for rejecting Jordan and Banks.
TITLE=> Trump Asserts Executive Privilege to Withhold Census Documents. ARTICLE=> President Trump asserted executive privilege over documents related to how a citizenship question was added to the 2020 U.S. census, preventing them from being disclosed. The documents have been demanded by a House committee that is investigating the controversial citizenship question the administration added to the census. The Justice and Commerce Departments have said the documents are part of litigation and can’t be released. The move came as the House Oversight Committee prepared to vote to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with its subpoena seeking information about the addition of the question. Democrats say the citizenship question will frighten illegal immigrants and prevent them from replying. The Supreme Court is deciding on the legality of adding the question.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Tim Scott and the GOP Rebuttal to Biden’s Speech. ARTICLE=> Following President Joe Biden’s first joint address to Congress Wednesday night, Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) delivered the Republican Party’s official response. Scott, the only black GOP senator, spoke on several issues including race, the economy, and party politics, saying, “Our best future will not come from Washington schemes or socialist dreams.” Some criticized Scott’s speech on Twitter by calling him “Uncle Tim,” leading Twitter to block the trend in the name of promoting “healthy conversations.” Voices in left-rated outlets tended to criticize the speech, sometimes linking it to “Trumpian” rhetoric. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to praise the speech and criticize the left’s reaction, particularly the “Uncle Tim” insult.
TITLE=> Texas Democrats Leave State As Legislature Considers Voting Bill. ARTICLE=> Texas Democrats left the state Monday in an effort to prevent the Republican-controlled state legislature from passing a voting bill. The bill would require new forms of voter identification for mail-in voting and prohibit drive-thru voting and overnight early voting. Supporters of the bill say it would enhance election integrity and security; those who oppose the bill say it would restrict voter access in marginalized communities. When the original bill was introduced in late May, Democrats staged a walkout; the new legislation omits a ban on Sunday morning voting, which many Democrats claim targets black voters. The New York Times reported that more than 51 of the 67 State House Democrats left for Washington, D.C. Monday to deny Republicans the minimum number of people required to conduct business. Democratic lawmakers could face arrest for leaving the state under Texas law. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. The left and center tended to focus on the details of the bill; some on the right, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, criticized Democrats for leaving much of their work undone. 
TITLE=> Biden Moving Up Vaccine Eligibility Date to April 19th. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, President Joe Biden is to announce that he is shaving about two weeks off of his May 1 deadline for states to make all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, moving the eligibility date to April 19th. Biden is also expected to announce that the United States has administered 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, putting the president on track to meet or exceed his goal of administering 200 million doses in his first 100 days in office. Biden will make the announcement at the White House on Tuesday following a visit to a vaccination site in Virginia.
TITLE=> McConnell Recognizes Biden as President-Elect. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recognized Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as president-elect and vice president-elect for the first time on Tuesday, following Monday’s confirmation of the 2020 presidential election by the Electoral College. “The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,” McConnell said. McConnell also said Biden “is no stranger to the Senate. He’s devoted himself to public service for many years.” Depending on the results of the Georgia Senate runoffs, Biden’s relationship with McConnell will likely be a key factor in the success of Biden’s agenda. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to describe McConnell’s statement as “delayed” and to discuss concerns about President Donald Trump’s election challenges. Some coverage from the right also discussed some Republican lawmakers’ continued refusal to acknowledge Biden’s victory.

TITLE=> Fact Checking the Georgia Senate Runoff Races. ARTICLE=> The candidates in Tuesday's pivotal U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia have often criticized their opponents, but haven't always done so based on fact. In general, fact-checking is done more overall by left and center-rated news outlets, and that was reflected in fact-checking around the runoffs. Many of those articles were comprehensive in explaining falsehoods spread by candidates on both sides; some focused specifically on false claims from incumbent Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Fact checks from right-rated sources often concentrated on false, misleading or incomplete claims made by Democrat challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.
TITLE=> Need-to-know Coronavirus Advice and Information. ARTICLE=> There's a lot to sift through when looking for information on the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, so AllSides is bringing together the best advice, research and more to help you manage the crisis in your own life. In addition to expert guidelines on staying safe and avoiding infection, reporting throughout the media spectrum has focused on advice for preserving mental health, performing essential tasks like food shopping, maintaining social connections and more.
TITLE=> Key Democrat Won't Support Major Election Bill. ARTICLE=> Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) published an op-ed Sunday in the Charleston Gazette-Mail explaining why he won't vote for the For the People Act, a Democratic-backed bill aimed at revamping voting access in U.S. elections. Manchin criticized the bill as partisan and said it "will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy." After passing the House along party lines, Senate Republicans blocked the bill's passage with a filibuster last month. Manchin's opposition to the bill likely means it will fail to pass in Congress. 	Coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted Manchin's criticisms of the legislation, especially his opinion that the law would fuel division and polarization around elections. Reports from left-rated sources often speculated about what the news means for the future of voting rights legislation; some also focused on how Manchin's resistance to this and other bills is at odds with key parts of President Joe Biden's agenda.
TITLE=> Fact-Checking Biden's CNN Town Hall. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden did a town hall event with CNN Tuesday night in Milwaukee, taking questions in his first public appearance as president outside of Washington D.C. According to fact-checkers, the president made several false, misleading or conflicting statements during the event, about subjects such as school reopening, the COVID-19 vaccine and the minimum wage. These became a focus of media coverage across the spectrum, but more for right-rated media outlets. Many right-rated fact-checkers focused on Biden's remark during the town hall that "we didn't have" a COVID-19 vaccine when he took office, a false sentiment echoed earlier in the week by others in the Biden administration. Many on the right framed this as a clear lie worthy of scrutiny. Left-rated fact-checkers attempted to place this remark in context with some of Biden's other comments from earlier in the night about the vaccine, framing his statement as a blunder instead of an intentional falsehood. Some right-rated voices then accused left-rated outlets of media bias, comparing their scrutiny of former President Donald Trump to their scrutiny of Biden, and alleging that they covered for Biden by explaining his remarks as "gaffes" instead of purely fact-checking them.
TITLE=> Gowdy and Rosenstein Engage in Tense Exchange Over Russia Probe. ARTICLE=> Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy accused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray of withholding documents related to the Russia probe, telling the Justice Department in a tense exchange to “finish it the hell up because this country is being torn apart.”
TITLE=> Merck Says It Has First Effective Antiviral Pill To Treat COVID-19. ARTICLE=> American drugmaker Merck announced Friday that it will seek emergency authorization of an experimental antiviral pill known as molnupiravir after it significantly reduced the worst effects of COVID-19 in clinical trials. The company said that in the trials, the treatment cut the risk of hospitalization or death in half when given to high-risk patients within the first five days of COVID-19 symptoms. By inserting errors into the virus' genetic code, the drug can reportedly minimize the duration of illness, mitigate serious symptoms and "limit transmission to people in your household if you are sick." Some experts are "optimistic that molnupiravir can become an important medicine as part of the global effort to fight the pandemic" if authorized, alleviating pressure on hospitals and curbing infections in poorer areas across the globe. Merck said it expects to complete the third phase of trials by early November. Two other antiviral pills are being developed: one by Pfizer, and the other by Atea Pharmaceuticals and Roche. Both are expected to release their trial results in the coming months. Coverage was prominent across the spectrum, with most outlets highlighting hopeful barometers that molnupiravir could play a key role in ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Some outlets also emphasized how White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients said the antiviral pill could be an “additional tool in our toolbox” but that vaccinations remain the strongest tool. 
TITLE=> Trump Says His Pre-Breach Rally Speech Was Appropriate, Condemns Efforts to Remove Him. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that the speech he gave last week before the breach of the U.S. Capitol building "was totally appropriate." He added that "you always have to avoid violence" and called attempts to push him from office "a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics." The comments were Trump's first in public since last Wednesday's events. The House of Representatives will vote on impeaching Trump Wednesday for "inciting insurrection" that lead to the deaths of five people during the Capitol breach. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo. ), the third highest-ranking GOP member of the House, came out in support of removing the president Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, federal law enforcement has reportedly opened more than 170 criminal cases in connection with the breach of the U.S. Capitol building; some individuals may be charged with sedition. Coverage of the news dominated headlines across the spectrum Tuesday. Some left-rated outlets framed Trump's remarks as insensitive; some right-rated sources focused more on Trump's criticism of attempts to remove him from office.
TITLE=> Trump Administration Drops Citizenship Question From Census. ARTICLE=> The Trump Administration dropped plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, after the Supreme Court ruled that officials failed to explain the necessity of the question.
TITLE=> Shanahan Out, Esper Named Acting Secretary of Defense. ARTICLE=> Former Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has been removed from the pentagon, and replaced by Army Secretary Mike Esper, Tuesday. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, was President Trump's pick for the permanent position, but an FBI investigation into a 2010 domestic dispute has been speculated to slow down the nomination and confirmation process. Shanahan and his ex-wife have both accused each other of assault, with her being arrested at one point. Apparently, those charges were dropped and led to the divorce. President Trump tweeted this morning that Shanahan had decided not to continue with his nomination process in order to spend more time with his family.
TITLE=> Trump Declares National Emergency. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has officially declared a national emergency regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. This initiates the Stafford Act, giving Trump control of roughly $42 billion worth of disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The move was called for by Capitol Hill on Thursday; Stocks rebounded following the declaration.
TITLE=> Unsealed Records Detail Alleged Abuses, Accomplices of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. ARTICLE=> Hundreds of transcripts and court records unsealed Thursday offer more details around the alleged high-profile sex crimes enabled and committed by the late Jeffrey Epstein and accused accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The high-profile names mentioned in the documents, including Britain's Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton, were the focus of substantial media coverage. Coverage from many right-rated outlets focused heavily on the fact that the documents suggest Clinton flew on a plane to Epstein's island, which was allegedly the site of sexual misconduct and abuse of underage girls. The details about Clinton received far less coverage from left- and center-rated outlets, which generally concentrated more on the case as a whole, or on other accused celebrities.
TITLE=> Trump Team Sues Capital One And Deutsche Bank Over Democrat Subpoenas. ARTICLE=> President Trump and the Trump Organization filed suit against Capital One and Deutsche Bank to stop them from complying with subpoenas from Congressional committees.
TITLE=> U.S. Deficit, Nearing $1 Trillion, Reaches Seven-Year High. ARTICLE=> The U.S. government's budget deficit reached nearly $1 trillion this year, its highest level since 2012. According to a Treasury Department announcement on Friday, the country's fiscal imbalance grew $205 billion, or 26 percent, over the 2019 budget year, bringing the total tally up to $984 billion. Several outlets on both sides of the aisle pointed out that the economic news contradicts one of President Donald Trump's main campaign promises, which involved eliminating the federal debt within eight years.
TITLE=> Trump Arrives at UN General Assembly.

TITLE=> European Countries Suspend Use of AstraZeneca Vaccine Over Blood Clot Reports. ARTICLE=> Several European countries temporarily suspended use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine after at least 37 reports of people who received it experiencing life-threatening blood clots. The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that it had found “no indication” so far that the vaccine caused the clots, and AstraZeneca said there had been 37 reports of blood clotting out of 17 million Europeans vaccinated. Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Latvia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Bulgaria, Ireland, the Netherlands suspended use of the vaccine, as did Venezuela, Indonesia and Thailand, although Thailand reauthorized it on Tuesday. AstraZeneca is reportedly expected to apply for FDA authorization in the U.S. by late March or early April. As of Tuesday afternoon, coverage was more prominently featured in some left- and center-rated outlets than in right-rated outlets, which tended to highlight stories about immigration. Coverage followed similar narratives across the spectrum.
TITLE=> WHO Calls for Halt to Vaccine Booster Shots as World Reaches 200 Millionth Case of COVID-19. ARTICLE=> The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for a moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots until at least the end of September to give all countries the chance to vaccinate at least 10% of their populations with at least one dose. The same day, the world saw its 200 millionth detected case of COVID-19, as countries with low vaccination rates continued to struggle under the pandemic.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained the move, saying, “So far, more than 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. More than 80% have gone to high- and upper-middle income countries, even though they account for less than half of the world’s population. I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.” Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum and more prevalent in left- and center-rated outlets. As of Wednesday evening, most major right-rated outlets used an Associated Press article for their coverage.

ARTICLE=> The United States Department of Agriculture proposed a new rule to stop automatically providing food stamps to people already on other forms of federal and/or state assistance. The rule would cut about 3.1 million Americans off of the food stamp program and save about $2.5 billion per year. Left-leaning and right-leaning media are reporting similarly, with more of the focus on affected citizens than government savings.
TITLE=> U.S. Switches Stance on Israeli Settlements in West Bank. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that the U.S. government no longer considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be a violation of international law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement showing support for the move soon after. Most reporting outlets, regardless of political leaning, concentrated on the purportedly sudden shift in policy, as the U.S. has generally opposed Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory.
TITLE=> Trump Put Hold On Military Aid To Ukraine Days Before Call To Ukrainian President. ARTICLE=> President Trump ordered a hold on military aid to Ukraine days before calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Trump Administration says the hold was tied to concerns about corruption, and that Trump wanted to be sure the new Ukrainian president was going to take steps to end corruption. Some Democrat lawmakers see the hold on military aid as an effort by President Trump to pressure a foreign government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.

TITLE=> US Coronavirus Cases Top 3 Million. ARTICLE=> The total number of COVID-19 coronavirus cases topped three million this week in the U.S. New cases are surging in some states, especially in the Sunbelt, but are remaining steadily low or decreasing in other regions. The surges in specific states, particularly Florida, have been the focus of media coverage on all sides of the political spectrum. Many sources, especially left-rated ones, framed the newly reached mile stone as "grim" and "concerning." Most reports referenced laziness with social distancing guidelines and testing troubles as potential causes for the rise; some coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated on the falling COVID-19 death rate.
TITLE=> Bush Delivers Speech For Democracy, Against Bigotry. ARTICLE=> Former President George W.

TITLE=> Trump Commutes Roger Stone's Prison Sentence. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Donald Trump commuted his former advisor, Roger Stone, of his 40-month prison sentence. Stone was convicted of lying to Congress, obstructing an investigation, and tampering with a witness during a congressional probe into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential elections. A White House statement released Friday said Stone was a “victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency." Coverage from the left tended to focus on the fact that Trump and Stone were longtime friends, highlighting Trump's broad use of his pardoning power throughout his presidency to those sympathetic to his administration. Some coverage from right-rated outlets emphasized the White House's "Russian Hoax" narrative, though it must be noted that Stone's charges were not for participating in the alleged Russian interference itself, but for interference in Congress' investigation.
TITLE=> Fact Check: Reports Misleading on Status of Immigrant Children. ARTICLE=> Misleading reports that said 1500 immigrant children had been "lost" caused backlash and a viral hashtag, #WhereAretheChildren?. However, media had conflated multiple stories about immigration: those 1500 children had arrived at the border unaccompanied and were not supposed to be in government custody.
TITLE=> Navy Captain Dismissed After Coronavirus Complaint. ARTICLE=> U.S. Navy officials have relieved Capt. Brett Crozier, the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, after he raised concerns about the health of his crew amid an outbreak of COVID-19 aboard the vessel. In a letter to the Pentagon that was later leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, Crozier wrote that they risked "failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our sailors.”   Outlets on the left have concentrated on the apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in how Navy command acted in relieving Capt. Crozier, as well as his standing ovation from his sailors after his firing. Right-rated sources, meanwhile, focused more on Crozier's purported poor judgement in sending a message through unsecure channels and not bringing his complaints directly to his Commanding Officer.
TITLE=> Deadly Shooting at Thousands Oaks, California Bar. ARTICLE=> A hooded gunman opened fire at a country dance bar last night, killing 12 people. The gunman was also found dead at the scene,
TITLE=> Planned Parenthood Removes President Leana Wen. ARTICLE=> Planned Parenthood removed president Dr. Leana Wen from office on Tuesday.

TITLE=> New York Times Flip-Flops on Tom Cotton's Op-Ed. ARTICLE=> After receiving backlash for publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) Wednesday, the New York Times added an editor's note to the article stating that it "fell short of our standards and should not have been published." Cotton's column advocated for the use of military force to curb nationwide protests and riots following George Floyd's death in police custody. While some left-rated voices offered support for diverse opinion sections, many criticized the Times for publishing Cotton's article, framing it as 'fascist' and arguing that it endangered black people, including the publication's own journalists. Many right-rated voices criticized the Times for backtracking, with some saying it was "no longer a marketplace of ideas" and accusing it of having an anti-conservative bias.
TITLE=> OMB Staffer Says Two Others Resigned Over "Quid Pro Quo" Concerns. ARTICLE=> Mark Sandy, a national security programs staffer at the Office of Management and Budget, testified this month that two other unnamed staffers resigned over concerns about President Trump's alleged misconduct in withholding aid from Ukraine, saying at least one was frustrated with a lack of clarity on why the aid was withheld. The story was covered prominently by many left and center-rated outlets, whose coverage focused on the resignations and quid pro quo allegations. Fewer right-rated outlets covered Sandy's testimony; the NR story was the only right-rated coverage to mention the resignations, while other right-leaning voices framed Sandy's testimony as supportive of claims that Trump had viable reason for withholding the aid.
TITLE=> More Than 280 WSJ Employees Pen Letter to Publisher Over Opinion Section. ARTICLE=> More than 280 Wall Street Journal employees signed a letter to the paper's publisher asking for harsher scrutiny and more fact-checking in the WSJ opinion section. The letter cited examples of misinformation in a piece by Vice President Mike Pence about the second COVID-19 coronavirus wave, and "an erroneous conclusion" in a column about systemic police racism from Heather Mac Donald. The concern over the credibility of the outlet's opinion page follows similar scrutiny of the New York Times opinion section, which led to editor James Bennet resigning earlier this year, and purportedly influenced the departure of opinion writer Bari Weiss. The news has not garnered significant media attention, with the majority of reports coming from left-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Biden Offers $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill Funded by Corporate Tax Hike, 15% Tax Minimum. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden offered to lower his infrastructure deal to $1 trillion in an attempt to reach a bipartisan compromise on Thursday, the Washington Post reported. In the meeting with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.), Biden also proposed a 15% minimum tax on corporations, as well as possible revenues from increased IRS enforcement. The new proposal by Biden is significantly lower than his initial $2.3 trillion proposal; however, it is still higher than the Republican $928 billion counteroffer that would draw much of the money from unspent funds originally set aside for coronavirus relief legislation and $257 billion in new spending. Biden, however, is still reportedly still committed to funding the bill with a corporate tax hike, which the GOP has taken a firm stance against as it would undo the party's 2017 tax cuts. Biden is expected to meet again with Capito Friday.  Coverage from across the political spectrum analyzed the likelihood of the newest proposal gaining GOP approval. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight the fact that the new proposal would still be funded with a corporate tax hike; left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the 15% tax floor. 
TITLE=> COVID-19 Hospitalizations Remain High, as Some Question the Number's Accuracy. ARTICLE=> The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations has fallen in recent weeks but remains high after rising for most of the summer. Now, new research is questioning the number's relevance. 	The current 7-day average of new COVID-19 hospitalizations is 11,754 as of Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some hospitals in the South and elsewhere are reportedly suffering from staffing shortages and overcrowded intensive care units (ICUs) as hospitalizations increase. These hospitalizations have often been used as a key measurement of the pandemic's intensity. A preprint, non-peer reviewed study from V.A. hospital researchers questions that metric, based on the fact that the data doesn't specify the intensity of symptoms and that prior vaccination may offer patients extra protection. According to the researchers, roughly half of all hospitalized patients on COVID-data dashboards in 2021 may have only had a mild or asymptomatic case of COVID-19, or may have been admitted for a different, non-COVID-19 reason. 	Stories of crowded, understaffed hospitals have been covered frequently by outlets across the spectrum, particularly left- and center-rated sources. The subject has been covered less frequently by right-rated outlets and voices. Skepticism about using the hospitalization metric was seen from left-rated and right-rated voices; these voices noted potential limitations of the V.A. researchers' study while questioning the media and the government for purportedly misusing the hospitalization figure.
TITLE=> Trump to Impose 25 Percent Tariffs on Goods From China. ARTICLE=> President Trumps's announcement that he will impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods from China has drawn mixed reactions: Some say it will hurt American businesses and consumers, who will foot the majority of the bill, while others say that the duties will even out the trade relationship between China and the U.S., which Trump says is weighted in China's favor.

TITLE=> Twitter Marks Trump Tweet as Breaking Rules on 'Glorifying Violence'. ARTICLE=> Twitter determined a tweet from President Donald Trump in regards to the Minneapolis riots broke the platform's rules on glorifying violence. The president's tweet denounced the riots, and stated that "when the looting starts, the shooting starts," in apparent reference to possible military intervention. Twitter placed a warning label on the tweet, alongside a message saying the platform determined that the tweet should still be publicly accessible. Coverage from left-rated outlets generally characterized Trump's tweet as a threat. Coverage from some right-rated outlets framed Twitter's efforts as unjust censorship; some right-rated voices concentrated more on tweets in support of the riots, which they argued violated the same rules on glorifying violence.
TITLE=> White Supremacists Hold White Lives Matter Rally. ARTICLE=> White supremacists held a "White Lives Matter" march in Tennessee on Saturday, chanting the Nazi slogan "blood and soil" and “closed borders, white nation, now we start the deportation.” They were met by hundreds of counterprotesters, which led to the cancelation of their second rally.

TITLE=> Biden Delivers Thanksgiving Address. ARTICLE=> Projected 2020 presidential winner Joe Biden delivered a Thanksgiving address on Wednesday afternoon from Wilmington, Delaware. In his speech, Biden made an appeal to unity while underscoring the severity of the pandemic. “We need to remember, we’re at war with the virus, not with each other,” Biden said, asking Americans to be resilient and persevere through the holiday season while adhering to gathering and travel restrictions. According to John Hopkins University, there have been more than 12.6 million cases of COVID-19 coronavirus in the U.S., and more than 260,000 people have died. The first emergency COVID-19 vaccines may be available as early as mid-December. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight his appeal for Americans to observe restrictions. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame Biden's address as unifying. Some left- and center-rated outlets also contrasted Biden's speech with Trump's continued remarks about election fraud and his pardoning of former security advisor Michael Flynn.
TITLE=> US Jobless Claims Fall to Pandemic Low. ARTICLE=> U.S. jobless claims reached their lowest level of the COVID-19 pandemic last week, falling to 684,000 from 781,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims are now at the lowest point since mid-March of last year and below the pre-pandemic high of 695,000. Some see this as a sign that the U.S. economy is slowing recovering. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says some sectors hit hardest by the virus remain weak.
TITLE=> Larry Flynt Offers Reward for Dirt on Trump. ARTICLE=> Larry Flynt, the founder of Hustler Magazine, is offering $10 million to anyone who has information that leads to the impeachment of President Trump.

TITLE=> Georgia, California Certify Election Results For Biden. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced that the state certified the results of the presidential race in Joe Biden's favor, after a second recount requested by the Trump campaign. "We have now counted legally cast ballots three times, and the results remain unchanged," Raffensperger said. If the margin between the candidates is under 0.5%, state laws allow requests for a recount. President Donald Trump requested a recount after the results initially showed Biden leading by a margin of 12,670 votes in Georgia. The final tally showed Biden won by under 12,000 votes. The Georgia lawsuit was a part of lawyer Sidney Powell's promise to "release the Kraken," referring to lawsuits that would purportedly reveal decisive voter fraud. Georgia's announcement comes one day before Congress approves results already certified by each state. On Dec. 4, California also certified its election results in Biden's favor, giving him more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president. The Georgia state results were covered by outlets across the political spectrum.

TITLE=> Coronavirus Pandemic Puts Stress on National Park System. ARTICLE=> National parks across the U.S. are experiencing intense pressure during the coronavirus pandemic, as millions of Americans seeking to escape virus-stricken urban centers flock into nature. Three of the country's most famous parks --  Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Great Smoky Mountains — shut their gates this week, while many others have appealed for permission to close amid employee and visitor worries regarding exposure to the virus. All parks remain free after the Interior Department suspended entrance fees last week in an effort to make it easier for people to get outdoors. Outlets on both sides of the aisle covered last week's announcement, while many on the left and center this week focused on the growing concerns about overcrowding.

TITLE=> National Guard Deployed and Armed to Defend Capitol Building Ahead of Biden Inauguration. ARTICLE=> The National Guard was armed with lethal weapons Tuesday night as it fortified the area surrounding the U.S. Capitol building ahead of Congress' debate over impeaching President Donald Trump. Up to 20,000 troops will be deployed in Washington D.C. leading up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, up from Monday’s commitment of 15,000. This comes as the FBI warns of “armed protests” against the inauguration being planned in all 50 states and D.C. Despite the warnings, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris still plan on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition. Some outlets on all sides published coverage of photographs of National Guard troops sleeping on the floors of the Capitol building. Some right-rated outlets compared the number of National Guard troops to the number of troops currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to be more blunt in linking President Trump to past and future armed protests against the election.

TITLE=> Senate GOP Crafts $1T Virus Relief Bill; Dems Stick to $3T Plan. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans are working on a $1 trillion COVID-19 coronavirus relief bill, while Democrats seem committed to their $3 trillion HEROES Act proposal, which passed through the House of Representatives in May. The Republican proposal is expected to include more stimulus checks, boosted funding for testing and schools, and continued but reduced unemployment benefits. Prominent Democrats have denounced the bill as failing to meet the country's needs; the HEROES Act is centered around hazard pay for essential workers, rent/mortgage relief, and aid for state and local governments. Coverage from right-rated outlets zoomed in on the steeper cost of the HEROES Act, and on Democrats' apparently curt rejection of the GOP idea. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed the Republican pitch as inadequate and misdirected. Reports from throughout the spectrum noted that Republican lawmakers are still uncertain on the legislation's final details.
TITLE=> Progressives Rebel as Pelosi Plans Infrastructure Vote. ARTICLE=> Leaders of the House Progressive Caucus said Tuesday that they would tank the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill — which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to bring to a vote this week — unless Senate Democrats first agree to a version of their $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation proposal. Pelosi announced her plans on Monday after she said Senate Democrats would need more time to work out their differences on the larger bill. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden met separately with Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, both of whom have publicly opposed the $3.5 trillion price tag.  Coverage was more prominent in D.C.-focused outlets like Politico and The Hill. Coverage varied across the spectrum on calling the Democrats planning to block the infrastructure bill "Liberal Democrats," "Progressive Democrats," or other labels. Coverage in some right-rated outlets framed these Democrats as holding the infrastructure bill "hostage."
TITLE=> Trump Picks State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert As Next UN Ambassador. ARTICLE=> President Trump appoints State Department's Heather Nauert as the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Role of Police and Law Enforcement in the US. ARTICLE=> The role of the police and law enforcement officials in a civil society is under the microscope following George Floyd's death in police custody last week. Floyd's death, which happened after a police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, set off a chain of public protests and anger across the U.S. Some voices, particularly on the left but also located throughout the spectrum, questioned the notion that police and law enforcement keep the public safe, and advocated for de-funding them. Some voices focused instead on stories of well-intentioned police officers, while others explored realistic possibilities for widespread police reform. Some right-rated voices argued that most police officers are committed to helping communities, while very few are overly violent or abusive.
TITLE=> Trump Pardons Arpaio. ARTICLE=> President Trump issued his first presidential pardon to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court. Arpaio is the controversial former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.

TITLE=> Budget Deficit Totals Hit $735B through January. ARTICLE=> The Treasury Department reported Wednesday that the U.S. budget deficit reached $735.7 billion in the first four months of the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. This year's deficit, which comes amid a recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, cut into tax revenues, while relief measures caused outlays to skyrocket. The deficit is 89% higher than the $389.2 billion deficit run up in the same period for the previous fiscal year. The deficit totaled for the month of January hit a record of $182.8 billion; one of the largest spending categories last month included $139 billion for another round of individual $600 stimulus checks as part of the $900 billion relief measure passed in December. President Joe Biden is also pushing for another $1.9 trillion relief measure that would provide a round of $1,400 payments. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Outlets from all sides highlighted the details of the deficit, and some provided analysis in regard to stimulus checks and their potential impact on the budget deficit.
TITLE=> Bulk of Obamacare Likely Safe in New Supreme Court Case. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court will likely not threaten the bulk of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, after Justices Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts said they supported leaving the rest of the law intact if they struck down the individual mandate. The individual mandate, which a group of Republican states is arguing against in California v. Texas, refers to a fee paid if you can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it. In 2017, a GOP-led Congress lowered the individual mandate fee to $0. Some coverage on all sides discussed Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s new place in the Court’s new 6-3 conservative majority. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to mention that Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett were appointed by President Donald Trump.
TITLE=> Biden Admin Actively Considering Mask Mandates for Vaccinated People. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration is considering a return to mask mandates for all Americans, including people who are fully vaccinated, amid a nationwide rise in COVID-19 cases that followed months of decline. Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the U.S. is going "in the wrong direction" on COVID-19 and stressed that the pandemic now mainly exists among the "50% of the country that are not fully vaccinated." Data from the New York Times (Lean Left bias) says the current 7-day average of new COVID-19 infections is 51,939; that number was roughly 260,000 at the pandemic's height in early January. Coverage from right-rated outlets often focused on the possible return to mask mandates, sometimes framing the idea as misguided and at odds with civil liberties. Reports from left-rated sources more often highlighted the unvaccinated, focusing on regions with low vaccinations rates and government efforts to convince people to get the shot. 
TITLE=> Romney Backs Pre-Election Vote on SCOTUS Nominee. ARTICLE=> Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) said Tuesday that he supports voting to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the Supreme Court before the November election.

TITLE=> Senate Confirms Merrick Garland As Attorney General. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate Wednesday voted to confirm Merrick Garland as attorney general. A longtime federal appeals court judge, Garland managed the investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and supervised the prosecution of the "Unabomber" Theodore Kaczynski. Garland will inherit several high-profile Justice Department cases, including the investigation the Jan. 6 breach at the U.S. Capitol, a probe into Hunter Biden's taxes, and John Durham's investigation of the origins of the probe into former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. During his Senate confirmation hearing last month, Garland said he would allow Durham's investigation to continue, and promised to remain impartial in the investigation into Hunter Biden. This comes after Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted last Wednesday that he is blocking the effort to expedite Garland's confirmation until he answers certain questions. Garland's confirmation was widely covered by outlets across the political spectrum. Some outlets from the left contrasted Garland with former AG William Barr. Some right-rated outlets highlighted several Republican lawmakers' opposition to Garland.
TITLE=> Israel Strikes Home of Hamas Leader, Building With Several Media Bureaus. ARTICLE=> On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike targeted Gaza city in an area that includes the home of a Hamas leader and an 11-story building that housed an Associated Press bureau and an Al Jazeera bureau. The building allegedly held “military assets belonging to the military intelligence of the Hamas terror organization,” Israeli authorities said, according to Al Jazeera. Israeli authorities reportedly ordered people to evacuate an hour before the airstrike. Al Jazeera condemned the attack in a statement, calling it a "clear act to stop journalists from conducting their sacred duty to inform the world and report events on the ground," while the Associated Press said on Saturday it was “shocked and horrified” by the Israeli air attack. Hamas continued to strike Israel over the weekend, including a barrage on Tel Aviv. On Saturday, the White House said that the safety of reporters covering the Gaza conflict "is a paramount responsibility." The airstrike and details of the attack received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from the right tended to focus on statements from the Israeli Defense Forces; coverage from the center and left tended to highlight statements from Al Jazeera and the Associated Press.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Washington Post Misquotes Trump, Prints Correction. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Washington Post made a correction to a January report about a phone call between former President Donald Trump and a Georgia elections investigator. The correction said several quotes attributed to Trump, which were attained through an anonymous source, were misquoted. In January, the Post reported that on a call, Trump said Georgia investigator Frances Watson should “find the fraud” and could become a “national hero” by doing so. A newly surfaced recording of the call with Watson revealed that Trump did not use those words. Trump said Watson could find “dishonesty” in Fulton County, and that “when the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised”; however, the language of the quotes attributed to Trump was inaccurate, and as a result, the Post ran a correction at the top of the article. Voices from across the political spectrum criticized the Post for the flawed report. Some voices from the right said the story pointed to wider issues with liberal outlets rushing to publish anonymous sources with partisan agendas. Trump criticized the Post for their mistake on Fox News Tuesday, but praised the Post's "courage" in making a correction. In a statement, Trump also renewed claims of "large-scale" voter fraud in Georgia. Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple argued that while the misquotes should not have occurred, the phone call itself also should not have occurred and that it does not change the fact that "Trump behaved with all the crooked intent."
TITLE=> Senate Acquits Trump In Second Impeachment Trial. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate voted to acquit former President Donald Trump on impeachment charges of inciting his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6. A majority of senators — 57 to 43 — voted to convict Trump, including seven Republicans. But a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, was needed to convict. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Trump on the grounds that the Senate lacked the authority to convict a private citizen, though he condemned Trump in a speech on the Senate floor after the vote. The story received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Right- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the trial and the arguments. Some voices from the left said the outcome highlighted Trump’s continued grip on most Republicans. This post was updated Sunday 2:06 p.m. ET for clarity.
TITLE=> California AG Xavier Becerra Confirmed as Biden's Health Secretary. ARTICLE=> The Senate voted 50-49 Thursday to confirm California attorney general Xavier Becerra as head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was the only Republican to vote in favor. Becerra's nomination by President Joe Biden was politically controversial, as many Republicans took issue with his stances on religious liberty and abortion. Democrats voiced concern during the confirmation process that delaying Becerra's confirmation could hinder pandemic recovery. Outlets on all sides, especially the right, focused on the near-party line vote. Some reports from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted the fact that Becerra is the first Latino to lead HHS.
TITLE=> Florida Breaks Record At 15,000 Coronavirus Cases In A Day. ARTICLE=> Florida reported 15,000 new COVID-19 coronavirus cases on Sunday, breaking a new record for highest cases in one day. As of Sunday, the U.S. reported more than 3.3 million cases and at least 135,205 deaths. Coverage of Florida's case numbers remained consistent across all sides of the political spectrum. Some right-rated outlets noted that while Florida's numbers are high, they are better equipped with medical resources than fellow virus hotspot New York City. Some left-rated outlets analyzed Florida's handling of the cases, noting how the mayor consistently puts a positive spin on the rising cases while ignoring the toll it is taking on state hospitals.
TITLE=> Whistleblower Says Facebook is Misleading the Public, Has 'Misaligned' Priorities. ARTICLE=> A data scientist and former Facebook employee accused the Big Tech company of privatizing profit over the public good in an interview with 60 Minutes Sunday night. Frances Haugen, who left the Facebook in May after it disbanded her unit that was assessing misinformation on the platform, said that "Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money." She added that "No one at Facebook is malevolent, but the incentives are misaligned." Haugen is scheduled to testify in Congress Tuesday. The interview followed a series of reports by the Wall Street Journal (Center bias) detailing Facebook's negative impact on teen mental health, neglect towards harmful issues with its algorithms and other scandals, for which a then-unidentified Haugen provided internal documents. Facebook's head of global safety testified before a Senate subcommittee last week and was questioned about the Journal's reports. The story was covered similarly across the spectrum. Some headlines from left-rated sources highlighted Haugen's mention of Facebook's role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
TITLE=> Coronavirus Outbreaks Spread as Public Gatherings Return. ARTICLE=> As lockdown restrictions loosen across the country, COVID-19 coronavirus outbreaks have popped up after people attend public gatherings. In the first week of the professional baseball season, more than a dozen players and staff for the Miami Marlins tested positive for COVID-19, leading the MLB and other sports leagues to re-evaluate their next steps. 71 percent of evangelical churches reportedly met in person for worship in July, and forty people tested positive for coronavirus after attending a church revival event in Alabama last week. In Nevada, more than one hundred cases have been linked to a casino. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to cover the various nationwide outbreaks more thoroughly.

McConnell also stuck by Congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) amid calls for her to be stripped of her House of Representatives leadership role following her vote to impeach former President Donald Trump.
TITLE=> Trump Signs 'America-First' Healthcare Order. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out his "America-First" healthcare plan. Trump's executive action includes a repeal of former President Barack Obama's original mandate, protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, improvement in care for veterans, and a lowered cost of prescription drugs. Trump previously said a healthcare plan would be released before the end of August. Others including Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and more Democratic lawmakers have criticized the plan, saying it is "largely symbolic" and doesn't put forth any real action. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame the order as "symbolic," and highlighted the fact that Trump's plan afforded protections for pre-existing conditions as his administration simultaneously attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of Trump's plan, often framing it as an "America-first" plan.
TITLE=> Senate Democrats Release $3.5 Trillion Budget Framework. ARTICLE=> Senate Democrats released a framework resolution for their $3.5 trillion federal budget plan on Monday, hoping to pass it by the end of the week after the Senate’s final vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The framework would be built upon by Senate committees this fall and does not include a provision to raise the debt ceiling. Democrats’ plans for the final bill include large investments in paid leave, childcare, universal pre-K, tuition-free community college, expanding Medicare, renewable energy and more, as well as increased taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Once the bill is complete, Senate Democrats plan to use budget reconciliation to overcome a Republican filibuster and pass the bill with a simple majority of 51 votes.  “Please remember that the resolution only includes ‘top-line’ reconciliation instructions to the committees, and that every Senator will have opportunities to shape and influence the final reconciliation bill after adoption of the Budget Resolution,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to his caucus on Monday. The same day, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged that Republicans would not support the bill, saying, “If they don't want Republicans' input. They don’t need our help.” Coverage was generally more positive in left-rated outlets and negative in right-rated outlets, with the former focusing on planned spending and the latter focusing more on tax increases. Coverage in several outlets framed the budget plan around a related issue, such as the plan’s lack of a debt ceiling increase. While some outlets across the spectrum featured this story prominently on homepages, others did not cover it at all. 
TITLE=> Perspectives: Placing Blame as Afghanistan Falls to Taliban. ARTICLE=> As Afghanistan falls to Taliban militants on the heels of the U.S. military's departure from the country, people in the U.S. and across the world are considering who or what is to blame. The Biden administration announced in April that the U.S. would leave Afghanistan completely by Sept. 11, 2021, and the last U.S. troops left Bagram Airfield, the main U.S. military base in the region for the past two decades, in early July; roughly six weeks later, the Taliban captured it. Former President Donald Trump and the Taliban reached an agreement in February 2020 that said all U.S. troops would leave the country by May 2021 in exchange for the Taliban agreeing to work with the Afghan government. Video of frantic Afghans fleeing the capital city of Kabul have dominated headlines across the spectrum and social media Monday. Voices across the political spectrum placed blame on the U.S. government's handling of Afghanistan over the past 20 years, as well as the Biden administration in particular, often framing the recent U.S. departure from the country as needlessly hasty; opinions from CNN (Left bias) and National Review (Right bias) both described Biden's handling of Afghanistan as a "debacle." Viewpoints from military personnel who served in Afghanistan were also seen across the spectrum; many blamed themselves for supporting a purportedly "aimless" U.S. effort to help stabilize the Middle East. Many voices from the right also highlighted a report that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has taken the week off; left- and center-rated outlets did not.
TITLE=> Trump Issues Executive Order Against TikTok, Senate Bans App From Government Devices. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that prohibits all transactions between TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and any company or person from the United States; the order is set to take place in 45 days. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate also unanimously approved a bill banning federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued devices. Under a Chinese law introduced in 2017, companies have an obligation to support and co-operate in the country's national intelligence work. Trump told reporters earlier this week that TikTok would be forced to cease U.S. operations by Sept. 15 if it wasn’t sold to a U.S. company. He also said that if a sale goes through, part of the proceeds should go to U.S. taxpayers. As of Thursday evening, coverage from all sides of the political spectrum remains consistent.
TITLE=> President Trump Praises Bill Barr For Taking Charge Of The Roger Stone Case. ARTICLE=> President Trump is praising Attorney General Bill Barr for "taking charge" of the Roger Stone case, a day after four federal prosecutors withdrew from the case. Their withdrawal came after the Justice Department intervened to seek a shorter sentence for Stone, who was found guilty last November of lying to Congress. Some Democrats are arguing that actions such as this are an abuse of presidential power, and are pushing to investigate the Justice Department's actions.
TITLE=> CNN Files Lawsuit Against White House Over Jim Acosta's Press Credentials. ARTICLE=> CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for suspending Jim Acosta's press credentials, alleging the move violates the First Amendment. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders responded by saying Acosta's "attempts to monopolize the floor" cost him his pass, after initially saying it was because he pushed an intern, a claim that was widely debunked. Experts are divided over who has the stronger case: some say it was a clear violation of free speech, arguing that Trump retaliated against Acosta over the content of his questions, while others contend it was Acosta's behavior that cost him his pass and that CNN has other reporters who can cover the White House.
TITLE=> Trump Administration Considers Legally Defining Sex as Biologically Fixed at Birth. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration is considering defining gender as biologically fixed at birth, a move that has been described by some as writing transgender Americans "out of existence," while others have said it is using obvious scientific and objective reasoning.
TITLE=> CDC Updates Guidelines Again, Says COVID-19 Can Be Airborne. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its COVID-19 guidance page to include information about potential for airborne transmission. In a statement on Monday, the CDC said people are more likely to become infected "the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19." The newest updates come after the CDC first updated, then reversed a similar statement about airborne transmission on its guidance page last month. In addition to transmission through small droplets that shoot through the air and fall to the ground, the CDC now warns of much smaller aerosol droplets that can remain suspended in the air. The changes to the guidelines in September suggested that the tiny aerosol particles may be the primary way the virus is spread; the agency removed the changes days later. Monday's latest revision acknowledges a role for airborne particles, but says it isn't the main way the virus spreads. Coverage from center- and left-rated outlets tended to focus on ways that the virus spreads, and analyzed the rest of the CDC's guidelines. Some right-rated outlets highlighted critics' fear that the information was being suppressed for political reasons by the Trump administration when the updates were reversed.
TITLE=> Video Appears to Show Police Shooting of Jacob Blake; Media Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> A viral video appears to show a man named Jacob Blake being shot multiple times by law enforcement in Kenosha, Wisconsin Sunday. Blake was opening the door of a car when an officer grabbed him, and gunshots can be heard immediately after. Blake is hospitalized in an intensive care unit as of Monday; Wisconsin's Justice Department is investigating the incident, and all involved officers have been placed on administrative leave, as is standard procedure following officer-involved shootings. Officers were pointing their weapons at Blake as he proceeded to walk away from them and around the other side of the car to open the door. It's unclear why Blake walked away from officers; police were reportedly responding to a domestic incident. Coverage and headlines from left-rated outlets generally focused on the fact that Blake was shot in the back; that the incident happened in front of his children; and on criticism of police from public officials, politicians and celebrities. Coverage and headlines from right-rated sources concentrated more on protests and violence that followed the incident. Some reports from right-rated outlets focused on the fact that Blake had previously been charged with domestic abuse, and that he was wanted by police at the time of the shooting for an alleged sexual assault.
TITLE=> Officer Indicted for 'Wanton Endangerment' In Breonna Taylor Case. ARTICLE=> Two police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor will not face charges, while one officer was charged with three counts of "wanton endangerment," a Louisville grand jury found Wednesday. Taylor was killed March 13 after police entered her home with a "no-knock" warrant searching for illegal drugs. Two recently conducted independent investigations concluded that officers made their presence known before entering. A former detective who was fired in June was charged with wanton endangerment of Taylor's neighbors. The two other officers were not charged because they were reportedly justified under Kentucky law in returning fire after Taylor’s boyfriend shot an officer. The announcement comes after a "state of emergency" was declared for Louisville police in anticipation of the case results. People gathered in downtown Louisville  Wednesday to protest the case results. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum focused on the details of the shooting and of the grand jury's charges. Some coverage from right-rated outlets emphasized the jury's justification of the officers, as well as the subsequent protests in Louisville.
TITLE=> Kerry Endorses Biden. ARTICLE=> Former Secretary of State John Kerry (D - MA) has officially endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden (D - DE), Thursday, expressing his belief that Biden is the candidate to beat President Donald Trump. Kerry served with Biden in the United States Senate; in 2004 Kerry was the Democratic nominee for President, losing to incumbent George W. Bush (R -TX). Kerry's announcement accelerates anticipation of the previous two Democratic nominees, former President Barack Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton, potential presidential endorsements.
TITLE=> New Law Makes Animal Cruelty a Federal Crime. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan act on Monday to make animal cruelty a federal crime. The Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act also bans videos which show animal cruelty, but makes exceptions for hunting. The act has been lauded by the Humane Society and Fraternal Order of Police, saying that federal law was necessary to prosecute interstate animal abusers. Some voices argue that the law is unneeded, as animal cruelty is already a felony in all 50 states.
TITLE=> FBI Warns Against Releasing FISA Memo.

TITLE=> Oil Prices Rise on Optimism About Russian-Saudi Negotiations. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that he spoke with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about Saudi Arabia possibly curbing oil production. In turn, bin Salman reportedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a cut in oil output. Oil prices rose steadily on the news of the apparent conversations, after dropping over 50% throughout March due in part to the COVID-19 outbreak. Most media outlets, regardless of leaning, speculated that the deal could prevent job loss for workers in the oil and gas industry.

TITLE=> Media Coverage of AOC Video Differs Vastly. ARTICLE=> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) explained her experience during the Jan. 6 Capitol breach in an Instagram live video Monday night that's been viewed millions of times across the Internet. Ocasio-Cortez covered several subjects in the video, including the breach and her feelings about the Republican party's responsibility for the violence. She also said for the first time publicly that she's a survivor of sexual assault. Most left- and center-rated outlines focused their headlines and coverage on Ocasio-Cortez's revelation of her experience as a sexual assault victim. Some reports from right-rated outlets concentrated instead on the skepticism the Democrat representative expressed in the video about whether Capitol police were actually trying to help her during the breach. One voice, writing in Slate (Left bias), questioned why many media outlets focused on the sexual assault angle rather than the other points she made about political violence and polarization.
TITLE=> North Korea Backs Off Guam Threat. ARTICLE=> North Korean state media says Kim Jong Un has decided not to fire on Guam.
TITLE=> DOJ to Reduce Recommended Sentence for Former Trump Adviser Roger Stone. ARTICLE=> The Department of Justice said Tuesday it would lower the recommended prison sentence for Roger Stone, former adviser to President Donald Trump. The initial recommendation of a 7-9 year sentence was made Monday night; the department reportedly said it made the decision to lower the recommendation before Trump tweeted that the proposed sentence was a "miscarriage of justice". Stone was convicted in November of lying to investigators and six other counts related to Congress' probe of possible Russian election interference in 2016. Several federal prosecutors reportedly resigned in protest of the department's backpedaling Tuesday. The story has been covered prominently by left- and center-rated outlets as of Tuesday afternoon, with some focusing on possible political interference between Trump and the DOJ that may have prompted the decision to cut back the previous sentencing recommendation.

TITLE=> Biden and McConnell Receive COVID-19 Booster Shots, Encourage Vaccines. ARTICLE=> Two top U.S. political leaders on opposite sides of the aisle received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine booster shot in recent days and encouraged people to get the vaccine. President Joe Biden got his COVID-19 booster shot Monday in front of news cameras; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced hours later that he'd also received the third dose. McConnell called it "an easy decision," and Biden joked that " it doesn't look like it, but I am over 65...And that's why I'm getting my booster shot today." The news followed CDC Director Rochelle Walensky's recommendation last week that the booster shot be made available for people ages 65 and older, and people ages 18 to 64 who are considered at high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their occupation. The news was covered similarly by sources across the political spectrum. Some sources on all sides highlighted how Walensky's recommendation overruled a CDC panel that voted against a third dose for Americans in high-risk jobs.
TITLE=> Trump Refers to Himself as a 'Nationalist'. ARTICLE=> President Trump referred to himself as a "nationalist" at a Texas rally, encouraging the audience to "use that word."

TITLE=> Biden Imposes Sanctions on Russia Over Cyberattacks and Election Interference, Declares 'National Emergency'. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration announced new sanctions against Russia on Thursday, declaring that Russia’s SolarWinds cyberattack, election interference and other actions amounted to a “national emergency.” The sanctions prohibited U.S. companies from buying or lending Russian-issued bonds, expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the U.S., and sanctioned 32 Russian entities and individuals for election interference as well as eight entities and individuals involved in Russia’s occupation of Crimea. The move also came as Russia built up its military presence near the Ukrainian border, raising fears of an invasion. Coverage in right-rated outlets was less common and tended to focus on Biden’s “national emergency” declaration. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was often featured prominently on homepages and focused on the sanctions themselves.

TITLE=> Iran Escalates Uranium Enrichment Ahead of Nuclear Deal Talks. ARTICLE=> Iran announced it had begun 60% uranium enrichment on Tuesday, much closer to the 90% required for nuclear weapons production than the 20% level reached in 2019 and the 3.67% limit required by the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The move is the latest escalation between Iran and Israel after multiple alleged attacks complicated upcoming talks with the Biden administration to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal. On Sunday, Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment site was allegedly sabotaged by an explosive device smuggled into the facility; while Israel did not claim responsibility, Israeli public radio reported that Mossad, Israel’s security force, played a “central role.” Iran vowed revenge for the alleged attack, reportedly firing a missile at an Israeli-owned ship on Tuesday. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Sunday as part of an official visit, prompting speculation on whether the U.S. had advance notice of the alleged Israeli attack. Outlets from across the spectrum covered various developments in this story; coverage in right rated outlets was less likely to mention the uranium enrichment limit from the 2015 nuclear deal.
TITLE=> White House Staffing Changes. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to implement several staffing changes, with Johnny DeStefano expected to oversee the political department as well as take over most of deputy chief of staff Richard Dearborn's duties, who will be leaving in the new year.
TITLE=> Trump Vows to Cover Pre-existing Conditions; Protections Already Exist Under Obamacare. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Donald Trump said in a New Jersey press conference that he would consider an executive order that would require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. In the press conference, Trump said that this is something that has "never been done before"; however, this is already covered under the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Trump administration is currently battling the ACA and its pre-existing medical protections in the Supreme Court.

TITLE=> New Polls Show Trump Closing the Gap on Biden. ARTICLE=> A CNN poll published Sunday evening shows President Trump closing the gap on presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden among registered voters. According to the latest CNN poll released Sunday night, 50 percent of registered voters say they will cast their ballot for Biden, compared to 46 percent who plan to support the president. The 4 point margin is down dramatically from the 14 point cushion Biden enjoyed in the last CNN poll, which was released back in early June. At the same time, an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday morning reports that more than half of registered voters, 53 percent, prefer Biden, while 41 percent favor Trump.

TITLE=> Second Whistleblower Emerges in Trump-Ukraine Controversy, According to Attorneys of First. ARTICLE=> Multiple outlets reported Sunday that a second whistleblower came forward in relation to President Donald Trump's interactions with Ukraine. Mark Zaid, the attorney for the CIA officer whose initial complaint last month catalyzed a presidential impeachment inquiry, says his team is now representing a second intelligence official, this one with "first-hand knowledge that supported the first whistleblower." The news comes days after House Democrats subpoenaed the White House and Vice President Mike Pence for documents related to the initial complaint. Coverage of the development was straightforward, with outlets like the Washington Examiner quoting Zaid himself and others referencing tweets by his partner, Andrew Bakaj. The New York Times was the first to report on Friday about the potential emergence of a second whistleblower.

It's the first COVID-19 vaccine to be upgraded from emergency use authorization to full approval; it was first approved for emergency use eight months ago. “While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock as part of Monday's announcement. 	There were few notable differences in initial coverage from left- and right-rated news sources. Reports from across the spectrum focused on how the approval may lead to vaccine mandates for service members, federal employees and college students, as well as how it may encourage skeptics to get the vaccine.
TITLE=> Trump Considers Preemptively Pardoning Family as DOJ Investigates Potential Pardon Bribery Attempt. ARTICLE=> Multiple sources confirmed Tuesday that President Donald Trump had discussed preemptive pardons for three of his children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Fox News' Sean Hannity also encouraged the president to preemptively pardon both his family and himself, because the left's “witch hunt” would allegedly “go on in perpetuity.” Additionally, newly released court documents show that the Department of Justice is investigating whether an unnamed individual attempted to bribe the Trump administration in exchange for a presidential pardon. President Trump called the investigation “fake news” in a Tuesday night tweet. Coverage of Trump’s potential pardons for his family came mostly from center- and left-rated outlets, with coverage in right-rated outlets focusing on a potential Rudy Giuliani pardon. Some left-rated outlets said the investigation raised “incendiary” new questions, and some right-rated outlets focused on Trump’s “fake news” tweet.
TITLE=> Trump Calls for End to Policy of Separating Immigrant Families. ARTICLE=> President Trump tweeted on Saturday to "put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law" that separates immigrant children from their parents. Publications on the Left have argued that Trump's attacks on Democrats are unfounded, since the policy comes from the Trump administration's Justice Department. Those on the Right have said that the "zero-tolerance" policy was put into place to deter illegal immigrants from coming to the U.S. This story comes amid much backlash for the recent revelation from a Health and Human Services official that the government was unable to locate nearly 1,500 children who had been released from its custody.

TITLE=> DACA Immigration Program Blocked By Federal Judge. ARTICLE=> Federal Judge Andrew Hanen ruled on Friday in Texas that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is illegal and hampered the program's ability to accept new applications. The Obama-era program, which was established in 2012, protected certain unauthorized immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation. The 616,000 people currently enrolled in the DACA program will not have their status affected until a further court ruling.  Most left-rated outlets used the term "undocumented" when referring to the immigrants affected by the ruling. The majority of right-rated outlets used the term "illegal." While center-rated outlets highlighted perspectives from both ends of the political spectrums, left and right voices heavily promoted their own view of the ruling.

ARTICLE=> State-certified 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden has chosen Susan Rice to lead the White House Domestic Policy Council and Denis McDonough as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Rice formerly served as U.N. ambassador and national security adviser for the Obama administration, and she was a favorite pick when Biden was choosing his running mate. McDonough served as deputy national security adviser and White House chief of staff for the Obama administration. Biden also announced he would nominate Marcia Fudge for Housing and Urban Development secretary, Tom Vilsack for Agriculture secretary, and Katherine Tai for U.S. trade representative. Most coverage from across the spectrum focused on Rice, and sometimes focused on both she and McDonough. Coverage from the right was more likely to discuss Rice’s role in the Obama administration’s response to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Coverage from center- and left-rated outlets tended to describe Rice as a “target of the GOP” because of that role.
TITLE=> Senate Strikes Down Class-Action Lawsuit Rule. ARTICLE=> The Senate has effectively rescinded the Obama-era rule that guaranteed individuals the right to bring class-actions suits against banks and credit card companies.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's VP Search Nears End. ARTICLE=> Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to officially select his 2020 running mate in the next few weeks. The ongoing search has garnered significant buzz, with many speculating about whether his choice will be a woman of color. Some left-rated voices focuses specifically on profiling Biden's possible choices, as well as examining his vetting process. Some right-rated voices focused on Republican contempt for Biden's potential running mates, and purported tokenism being enacted by Democrats in attempting to influence Biden's choice. Other coverage focused on Biden's campaign finance outlook.
TITLE=> Biden Cancels Trip, Focuses on Spending Bills as Votes Approach. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden canceled a Wednesday trip to Chicago and is staying in Washington D.C. as negotiations on his administration's spending bills have stalled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has planned a vote on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill Thursday, but progressives have pledged to vote against it unless the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package passes along with it. Moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Az.) oppose the $3.5T pricetag, and Republicans are also mostly unified in opposition to it. And if a federal funding bill is not passed by midnight on Thursday, the federal government will partially shutdown. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that the government will run out of resources to fund operations by mid-October if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended; Republicans have voted against efforts to raise the debt ceiling, saying they won't enable Democrats' purportedly reckless spending plans. Coverage across the spectrum highlighted the news Wednesday. Many reports framed the next two days as critical for Biden's agenda, and hinted that failure to pass the bills and avoid a government shutdown would have negative consequences for Democrats. 
TITLE=> Virginia Lawmakers Pass Red Flag Gun Legislation. ARTICLE=> The Virginia Senate passed a "red flag" gun law Thursday, one of several state gun control measures on the table that influenced a peaceful protest at the state Capitol two days ago. According to the bill's text, it's aimed at temporarily seizing firearms from people "posing substantial risk" to those around them. Similar laws have been passed in 17 other states and Washington D.C. Many reporting outlets focused on Virginia's Democratic-controlled Senate passing the bill in a 21-19 party-line vote, as well as Tuesday's rally. Many, especially left- and center-rated sources, also concentrated on lawmakers' stated intentions to preserve due process within the bill.
TITLE=> Whistleblower Says Facebook Puts 'Profits Before People' at Senate Hearing. ARTICLE=> Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified to the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection on Tuesday, telling senators that “Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy.” Haugen also said she had “strong national security concerns” about Facebook’s operations and that the company had “put their astronomical profits before people” and undermined “societies around the world.” Finally, Haugen called for Congress to take action, saying, “Congressional action is needed. They won't solve this crisis without your help.” Senators from both parties praised Haugen and criticized Facebook. Haugen previously appeared on CBS’s “60 Minutes” after releasing thousands of pages of internal Facebook documents to The Wall Street Journal.  Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum but more prominently featured in center- and left-rated outlets on Tuesday afternoon. At least one right-rated outlet framed Haugen as a “Leftist Activist.”
TITLE=> China's Coronavirus Updates Draw Skepticism. ARTICLE=> As China has begun sending medical supplies to other countries, the nation and its ruling party have drawn criticism from media voices throughout the spectrum for purported mismanagement of and lies regarding the crisis. Some argued that China's 'humanitarian' effort was meant to overshadow its role in the global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Others believed that this effort was meant to show superiority over other countries, like the United States, during times of crisis. Chinese state media has spread misinformation about the coronavirus, including the claim that the virus originated in the United States, despite all reports suggesting it originated in China's Wuhan province.

TITLE=> Nation Remembers Civil Rights Leaders John Lewis, C. T. Vivian. ARTICLE=> This weekend, the nation remembered the lives of civil rights leaders Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and C. T. Vivian, who both passed on Friday. Lewis was a civil rights activist who led nonviolent protests in the 1960s; most notably, Lewis led a march in Alabama that was halted by police brutality in 1965, now known as "Bloody Sunday." Lewis went onto serve over three decades in Congress; he was 80. Vivian, a Baptist minister and aide to Martin Luther King, Jr. was also bloodied on the front lines of the 1960s civil rights movement; he was 95. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted their lives and accomplishments; voices from the left also connected the civil rights movement they fought for with the Black Lives Matter movement occurring today. Coverage from right-rated outlets generally focused more on the White House's response, its order to have the flags lowered to half-mast, and speculation that Lewis might lie in state at the Capitol, an honor reserved for American heroes occurring just 36 times in U.S. history, though there is no official confirmation as of Saturday.
TITLE=> Trump Won't Participate in Virtual Debate with Biden. ARTICLE=> President Trump vowed Thursday not to participate in next week's debate with former Vice President Joe Biden after organizers announced it will take place virtually because of the president's coronavirus diagnosis.

Rolanda Hollis (D-AL) has introduced a bill to the Alabama state legislature that, if passed, would mandate vasectomies for men over the age of 50 or who have at least three biological children. The bill seeks to make a point against the regulation of reproductive rights by a government, specifically in the context of abortion. Hollis is quoted as saying, "It takes two to tango. We can't put all the responsibility on women. Men need to be responsible also." The state passed a near-total ban on abortions last May, but the bill was blocked by a district judge in October before its official implementation.
TITLE=> House Dems to Investigate Whether Trump Lied to Mueller. ARTICLE=> House Democrats are investigating whether President Donald Trump lied during his testimony to special counsel Robert Mueller. President Trump's testimony to Mueller was written, rather than orally answered, as negotiated by Trump's legal team. This prompts speculation on the possibility of perjury being included if articles of impeachment are brought against Trump. Media coverage differed along the left-right divide. Some right-leaning voices called the process 'unfair,' suggesting that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) are fishing for evidence of a crime.
TITLE=> ‘60 Minutes’ Criticized Over DeSantis Report, Video Editing. ARTICLE=> “60 Minutes,” a CBS News production, is facing criticism over a “deceptively” edited video of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis which omitted most of DeSantis’ nearly 500-word response to a CBS reporter. The 60 Minutes report drew a connection between a $100,000 donation from supermarket chain Publix and DeSantis’ announcement weeks later authorizing Publix to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. DeSantis and Publix have denied the alleged “pay for play” arrangement, and at least two Democratic Florida officials have rejected the allegations and criticized 60 Minutes’ reporting. Read a full transcript of the video exchange here. Coverage in right-rated outlets focused on steep criticism of 60 minutes by prominent right-wing figures, as well as on CBS’s lack of coverage on the story, and was more likely to describe the video as “deceptively” edited. Coverage was less prominent in left-rated outlets and used more neutral language.

TITLE=> Daily New U.S. COVID-19 Cases Dip Below 100,000, Health Officials Say It's 'Too Soon' To Ease Restrictions. ARTICLE=> The daily average number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. fell below 100,000 for the first time in months as vaccine rollouts progress, but experts cautioned Sunday that infections are still high and restrictions must remain in place. For the majority of December, the seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 infections was 200,000, and rose to approximately 250,000 in January, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Friday and Saturday, the average was below 100,000 for the first time since early November. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), urged Americans Sunday to keep their guard up, as the rate is still "around 1,500 to 3,500 deaths per day, which is more than two-and-a-half-fold times what we saw over the summer." The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Center- and right-rated outlets tended to focus on the dip in numbers; some left-rated outlets highlighted Walensky's urge for caution.
TITLE=> Understanding Racial Inequality. ARTICLE=> In light of Martin Luther King Day, news outlets debate the overarching state of racism in modern society. Some argue that the black civil rights battles are over, and that disparities between the races are not driven by racism, but by culture, such as trends surrounding marriage, education, and crime. Others say that racism is systemic, citing voter suppression, racial divides in schools, as well as studies that show blacks are sometimes scrutinized more heavily than their white peers.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Grants Trump Admin More Power to Quickly Deport Asylum Seekers. ARTICLE=> A Washington D.C. federal appeals court and the Supreme Court each handed down rulings this week that enhance the Trump administration's power to deport asylum seekers and people in the country illegally through expedited removal. The rulings prevent individuals from challenging their expedited removal in a federal court, allowing immigration officials to quickly deport people who have recently entered the country illegally. Coverage from right-rated outlets placed more focus on the supposedly slow deportation process that the rulings would prevent. Coverage from left-rated outlets concentrated more on the fact that the rulings could potentially endanger asylum seekers who fear retribution upon returning to their country of origin. Reports on all sides detailed the Supreme Court's 7-2 ruling, and the separate post-ruling opinions written by the conservative and liberal justices.

Asa Hutchinson Monday vetoed a bill that would have banned transgender treatments for youth in the state. The bill, known as the Safe Act, would prohibit doctors from providing hormone treatment, medication or surgery to anyone under 18, or from referring them to other providers for the treatment. Arkansas would have been the first state to take such a move; however, its majority-Republican legislature could still enact the policy using a simple majority to override the governor’s veto. Hutchinson’s veto comes after when he signed into a law a bill that bans transgender women and girls from playing female sports just one week ago. The Arkansas bills is among a number of state legislation that Republicans have introduced on transgender issues this year; at least 16 other states are considering similar legislation. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets included personal interviews from transgender people in their articles, while center- and right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the bill. Update: The Arkansas legislature voted Tuesday afternoon to override Gov. Hutchinson's veto.
TITLE=> Arrests Made in Portland and Seattle on Inauguration Day for Violence, Property Damage. ARTICLE=> Several arrests were made in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington on Inauguration Day Wednesday after people lit fires and caused property damage in scattered instances throughout the evening. People in Portland vandalized the state's Democratic Party headquarters and the offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); in Seattle, several businesses were vandalized and marchers reportedly decried ICE. Similar events were rare across the nation Wednesday as President Joe Biden was officially sworn in. There were reportedly also peaceful protests, both in the aforementioned cities and elsewhere throughout the country; many had speculated about potential political violence on Inauguration Day following the Capitol building breach on Jan. 6 that left five people dead. The news was covered throughout the spectrum, but significantly more prominently by right-rated sources, which were often quicker to label the events as violence. Some reports from right-rated outlets also framed the media and certain Democrat leaders in a critical light for not acknowledging the vandalism. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources placed more attention on the fact that most demonstrations Wednesday were peaceful.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Sides With Google in Copyright Dispute Case. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 6-2 in favor of Google in its long-running copyright dispute with Oracle. The decision affirms Google's argument that its use of Oracle's programming language, Java API, was fair use and not a threat to the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information.
TITLE=> Yellen Warns Congress of 'Economic Recession' if Debt Ceiling Isn't Raised. ARTICLE=> U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that members of Congress have until Oct. 18 to vote on raising or suspending the debt ceiling. She said the Treasury "would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly” if that deadline isn't reached, warning that it's “uncertain whether we could continue to meet all the nation’s commitments after that date.” America would default on the national debt for the first time in history, which Yellen said would lead to "a financial crisis and economic recession." Yellen’s letter was sent just hours after Senate Republicans on Monday voted against a measure to suspend the debt ceiling, arguing that it would enable more purportedly reckless spending from Democrats. The Bipartisan Policy Center recently estimated that the Treasury will run out of cash between Oct. 15 and Nov. 4; a report from Moody’s Analytics said a default could cause 6 million lost jobs and $15 trillion of lost household wealth. Yellen's comments were prominently covered across the spectrum. Left-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize how the Republican Party could avoid this potential "catastrophic" default. Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how Congress has "already passed" several COVID-19-related stimulus packages that are worth trillions of dollars; one voice argued that "the real problem" is the Democratic Party's support for some of the “biggest, most reckless spending social bills in U.S. history.”
TITLE=> David Pecker, National Enquirer Publisher, Granted Immunity in Michael Cohen Case. ARTICLE=> The National Enquirer's publisher, David Pecker, has been granted immunity in the Michael Cohen case and is reported to have kept a safe containing "damaging stories," including documents on the hush-money payments made to two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump.
TITLE=> Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down Ban on Handgun Sales to Those Under 21. ARTICLE=> A panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that a federal law banning the sale of handguns to those under the age of 21 is unconstitutional. The three-judge panel voted 2-1 on the law. "We first find that 18-year-olds possess Second Amendment rights," Judge Julius Richardson wrote in the majority opinion, adding that Congress used misleading data in 1968 to pass the law. "Congress may not restrict the rights of an entire group of law-abiding adults because a minuscule portion of that group commits a disproportionate amount of gun violence." Judge James A. Wynn Jr., who dissented, said the ruling opposed efforts to control gun violence. The law does not prohibit the possession of handguns by people under 21; it only prevents licensed dealers from selling to those under 21. The 4th Circuit's ruling will only apply to the five states of the circuit, which are Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.  The story received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Outlets on the right tended to focus on the majority opinion's reasoning and the Second Amendment, while some outlets on the left framed the story in the context of gun violence in America, and tended to speculate that the decision is likely to be appealed to the full court. 
TITLE=> Trump Willing to Testify. ARTICLE=> In a news conference on Friday, President Donald Trump stated that he would be willing to testify under oath following former FBI Director James Comey's Thursday testimony.

Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez (NY) are pushing forward on impeachment, and have been critical of Pelosi and others who haven't committed.
TITLE=> Los Angeles County Reinstates Indoor Mask Mandate. ARTICLE=> Los Angeles County announced Thursday it will reinstate an indoor mask mandate for residents regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status. The manate will go into effect on Sunday. This comes after the county suggested two weeks ago that both vaccinated and unvaccinated residents wear masks amid the spread of the Delta variant. “We’re not where we need to be for the millions at risk of infection here in Los Angeles County, and waiting to do something will be too late given what we’re seeing now,” county health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said Thursday. The Los Angeles Times (Lean Left bias) reported an average of 1,077 new cases each day in the past week, a 261% increase from the daily average two weeks ago. Davis said he expects the mandate to remain until the county sees improvements in case transmissions.  Coverage from the left and center tended to highlight rising COVID-19 case numbers in the county, and speculate whether other regions with surging case numbers would follow suit. Some voices on the right criticized the decision, calling it a "fear-driven" attempt to encourage more residents to get vaccinated. 
TITLE=> Trump Admin. Stops Cruises to Cuba. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday Morning, the Trump Administration announced a ban on cruise ships and recreational vessels from departing to Cuba. The Commerce Department and National Security adviser, John Bolton, indicated that the policy is intended to deny Cuba revenue and access to U.S. dollars. Restrictions on travel to Cuba were significantly lifted during May 2016. Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bruno Rodriguez Parilla, decried the restrictions as an "attack on international law."
TITLE=> MSNBC Shows Partial Clips of "Salute to America" Event in D.C.. ARTICLE=> MSNBC chose not to broadcast live coverage of the "Salute to America" event planned by President Donald Trump in Washington D.C. on Thursday. A spokesperson for the network told Politico it would not show the Fourth of July-themed event live, and instead would decide in real time what clips of the event to feature during scheduled programming. The network did publish a digital recap of the event, and also linked to live NBC News coverage of the event on Twitter. Few right-leaning media outlets and very few left-leaning outlets reported on this after the Politico story. Most other major television networks, regardless of ideology, featured partial or full coverage of the event.
TITLE=> Defense Considers Appeal for Derek Chauvin. ARTICLE=> The defense is considering an appeal for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted on Tuesday on all counts of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Odds may not be good for an appeal, considering about 90% of appeals are denied in the United States. However, an appeal is likely due to the massive publicity given to this case, the judge's denial of the defense's request to move the trial, and the potential bias created by remarks from political leaders such as Maxine Waters and President Biden.
TITLE=> Controversial Study Estimates "Superspreader" Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Linked to 266,000 COVID-19 Cases. ARTICLE=> A study from San Diego State University and the IZA Institute of Labor Economics suggests that last month’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew over 460,000 attendees to South Dakota, was a "superspreader" event potentially linked to 266,000 COVID-19 cases around the country. The Sturgis rally drew criticism in August due to health experts’ warnings against large gatherings. The study has received some criticism in peer reviews and strong pushback from some public officials. The researchers stand by their work, which was based on county-level data and anonymized cellphone tracking data. Many reports from right-rated outlets focused on researchers and public officials’ criticisms of the study. Coverage in some left-rated outlets discussed scientific criticisms of the study, and coverage in other left-rated outlets only discussed criticisms of the study towards the end of articles. Editor's Note: This story's headline has been updated to include the word "controversial". Updated 9/11/20 at 8:34 p.m. ET
TITLE=> Perspectives: Post-9/11 Unity, 20 Years Later. ARTICLE=> Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which left almost 3,000 dead and served as the inciting moment for the War on Terror. Americans and American allies came together in the aftermath; according to Pew Research Center, 79% of American adults said they displayed an American flag, trust in government rose to 60%, and then-President George W. Bush’s approval rating spiked to 86%, including 96% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats. While comparable levels of unity were reached prior to 2001—former President George H. W. Bush’s approval rating peaked at 89% in 1991—Americans today are sharply divided.  Commentators from across the political spectrum wrote articles on 9/11 in the week leading up to the anniversary. Most voices across the spectrum lamented America’s current divisions. Some voices noted that the death toll from COVID-19 matched 9/11’s death toll every two days. Voices in right-rated outlets were more likely to note the timing of the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Voices in left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight the experiences of Muslim Americans. 
TITLE=> White House Updates Public on Trump's Health. ARTICLE=> Several reports about President Donald Trump's trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center emerged after he tested positive for coronavirus Thursday night. White House physicians said Saturday morning that Trump’s condition was improving; the same day, a White House official told reporters that Trump's vitals over the last 24 hours were "very concerning." Saturday afternoon, Trump tweeted a video saying he thinks he will be back soon, and photos of himself working from the hospital. On Sunday, White House physician Navy Cmdr. Dr. Sean Conley  said Trump received supplemental oxygen treatment after he experienced two episodes of transient drops in oxygen levels. Conley also said that Trump started treatment with dexamethasone, a steroid used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients, along with two other drugs. On Sunday, Trump's medical team told press that the president could return to the White House "as early as Monday." Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on Trump's video and the report that he could return as early as Monday. Some right-rated outlets also highlighted Trump's supporters who gathered in prayer vigils for him over the weekend. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to frame the president's health updates as "conflicting," often highlighting the dexamethasone and oxygen treatments he received.
TITLE=> States Lift COVID-19 Restrictions Amid Vaccinations and New Variants. ARTICLE=> States across the nation are beginning to lift the restrictions  on restaurants and businesses as people get vaccinated and COVID-19 hospitalization numbers improve, although some remain cautious as a new variant of the virus pops up in the U.S. The states of North Dakota and Michigan, as well as cities Chicago and Washington, D.C., are among those that lifted bans on indoor dining this month, while California and New York's stay-at-home orders ended this week, though indoor dining still remains shut. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will announce a plan by the end of the week for potentially easing indoor dining restrictions. The story received wide coverage from left- and center-rated outlets, which tended to focus on the details of the states' restrictions. Some right-rated outlets pointed out that many of the cities and states who ended lockdown after President Joe Biden's inauguration were Democrat-run cities.
TITLE=> Facebook Board Upholds Trump Ban but Orders Review. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, Facebook's Oversight Board upheld the company's suspension of former President Donald Trump but instructed the company to determine a “proportionate response” going forward, a verdict that may determine how social media companies handle content violations going forward. In its decision, the board upheld Facebook's decision to suspend Trump in the wake of the January 6th violence at the U.S. Capitol, but it criticized the social network for issuing an indefinite suspension and ordered it to revisit the decision within six months. The determination by the board also applies to social media company Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Update 5/5/21 at 10:01 am: This roundup originally included an article from AP Politics (Lean Left bias), which we replaced with an article from BBC News (Center). We had incorrectly marked the AP article as having come from its Center-rated news section.
TITLE=> Warren to End Presidential Campaign. ARTICLE=> Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) ended her 2020 presidential campaign Thursday on a call with staff. Reporting media outlets focused mainly on Warren's poor Super Tuesday performance, her role as the race's only remaining female candidate, and her progressive policy stances, which right-rated outlets generally framed in a critical light. It's unclear if she plans to endorse another candidate.
TITLE=> Kyle Rittenhouse Will Not Face Charges in Illinois. ARTICLE=> Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old who was accused of killing two people and injuring a third with an AR-15 rifle during Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, will not face charges in his home state of Illinois. According to a news release by Lake County State's Attorney's Office, police in Rittenhouse's hometown of Antioch, where he turned himself in, investigated any possible crimes Rittenhouse may have committed in Illinois, but found none. The release also said prosecutors would release additional information "as to not disrupt any investigation that may be taking place in Wisconsin." Rittenhouse will continue to stay in a Lake County juvenile detention center as his lawyers attempt to block his extradition to Wisconsin, where he is facing six charges, including one count of first-degree homicide. The story was covered by outlets from across the political spectrum. Right-rated outlets also focused on the charges against another man who allegedly fired off a handgun amid the protests in Kenosha on the same night.
TITLE=> Biden Signs Executive Order on Climate Change. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday taking a wide range of actions to fight climate change. The actions include halting new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, taking steps towards doubling offshore wind power by 2030, and committing to conserve 30% of lands and oceans by 2030. The order also takes actions to establish “climate considerations as an essential element of U.S. foreign policy and national security.” Additionally, Biden signed a memorandum on scientific integrity and an executive order re-establishing the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Coverage on all sides tended to focus on the action halting new federal oil and gas leases. Some coverage in left-rated outlets described Biden’s actions as “ambitious.” Right-rated outlets focused more on criticisms of Biden's climate plan; some concentrated specifically on the Wednesday press conference where special presidential climate envoy John Kerry commented about oil and gas workers who may lose their jobs as a result of climate change action. Updated 1/27/21 at 4:56 p.m. ET with Kerry's comments.
TITLE=> Biden Revokes Trump Order Barring Immigrants Who Cannot Afford Health Care. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden reversed a 2019 executive order by former President Donald Trump that would have prevented immigrants from obtaining visas unless they proved they could obtain health insurance or pay for health care. “My Administration is committed to expanding access to quality, affordable healthcare,” Biden stated Friday. “we can achieve that objective...without barring the entry of noncitizens who seek to immigrate lawfully to this country but who lack significant financial means or have not purchased health insurance coverage from a restrictive list of qualifying plans.” The action is the latest of Biden's efforts to roll back the previous administration's policies; also on Friday, the White House made public an executive order revoking Trump's order to construct a “National Garden of American Heroes."

TITLE=> US House Condemns QAnon Group. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House of Representatives voted 371-18 Friday to issue a resolution condemning the online conspiracy theory QAnon. QAnon is centered around "Q," a purported high-level government official who spreads information on online forums about "deep state" conspiracies at work in the U.S. government. Republican representative Denver Riggleman, a sponsor of the resolution, condemned QAnon after a House Democrat this week started receiving death threats from QAnon followers; Riggleman also condemned QAnon for their alleged antisemitic remarks. In 2019, the FBI designated QAnon a domestic terrorist threat. President Donald Trump in the past has expressed support for followers of the movement. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the resolution; some center- and left-rated outlets highlighted the fact that 17 Republicans and one independent voted against the resolution. The story received less overall coverage from right-rated outlets, though it was covered by the Washington Examiner and Fox News, which highlighted Republican congressional hopeful Marjorie Taylor Green's criticism of the House for passing the resolution instead of condemning Antifa and Black Lives Matter.
TITLE=> New Coronavirus Variant Emerges Abroad. ARTICLE=> A new and possibly more contagious version of the COVID-19 coronavirus has emerged in several countries worldwide after first being confirmed in the United Kingdom earlier this month.

The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets tended to provide speculation about the details of Vance's investigation and what it could mean for the outcome. Coverage from right- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of Vance's probe. 
TITLE=> Protests in St. Louis. ARTICLE=> Protesters clashed with police officers Friday night in St. Louis after a white former police officer was acquitted on murder charges for the fatal shooting of a black driver after a car chase.

TITLE=> Trump Administration Unable to Reach 1,488 Migrant Children Placed With Sponsors. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration is reportedly unable to account for 1,488 migrant children who were placed with sponsors after crossing the border illegally, prompting lawmakers to introduce bipartisan legislation that would bolster the safety and security of minors who come the the U.S. unaccompanied. A spokeswoman for Health and Human Services said that the children in question "are not lost" and that "their sponsors — who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them — simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.”
TITLE=> House Democrats Pass $2.2 Trillion Stimulus Bill. ARTICLE=> House Democrats passed a scaled-down version of their $2.2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package on Thursday night after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to reach a bipartisan deal earlier in the week. The $2.2 trillion stimulus, decreased from the original $3.4 trillion HEROES Act in May, passed 214 to 207, with 18 moderate Democrats voting no on the bill in favor of waiting to reach a bipartisan agreement. The new bill would restore weekly $600 unemployment benefits, extend the Paycheck Protection Program that expired in early August, allocate $28 billion for a vaccine, provide another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans and increase funding for schools, airlines workers and COVID testing. Outlets from across the political spectrum focused on the details of the bill and its likelihood of becoming law without Republican support. Some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted  analysis suggesting federal stimulus does not help the unemployment rate.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Tara Reade Allegation and 'Believe All Women'. ARTICLE=> Tara Reade's allegation that presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee Joe Biden (D-DE) sexually assaulted her when she was a Senate staffer in 1993 has roiled the #MeToo movement, and specifically its standard of "believing all women" who've come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. Many right-rated voices are critiquing "believe all women" after some of its proponents recanted on the word "all" in the wake of Reade's allegation; some called out self-described feminists as hypocrites for purportedly changing their stance on sexual assault allegations to support a political agenda. Left-rated voices have generally been more skeptical of Reade's allegation, pointing to apparent inconsistencies in her story, while conversely focusing more on the 25 women who've accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct.
TITLE=> West Virginia's Entire Supreme Court Impeached. ARTICLE=> The entire West Virginia Supreme Court has been impeached by the state's House of Delegates, citing excessive spending.

TITLE=> Health Experts Urge Caution As States Push To Ease COVID-19 Restrictions. ARTICLE=> States are pushing to reopen businesses as COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed and new case numbers are declining, but health experts are still urging caution. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said Monday that “now is not the time” to lift restrictions; Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program, said Monday it is "premature" and "unrealistic" to think that the pandemic would disappear by the end of 2021. Despite these warnings, state governors across the country are lifting lockdowns, mask mandates and capacity limits. Last month, Massachusetts, North Carolina and New York allowed indoor dining to reopen at decreased capacity limits, while Iowa and Montana lifted statewide mask mandates earlier this month. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday he is considering removing all statewide coronavirus orders. The CDC estimates nearly 20% of adults have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 10% have been fully inoculated. Johnson & Johnson just distributed 4 million doses of its new one-shot COVID-19 vaccine Sunday, adding to vaccines being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna. Health experts' remarks about restrictions received coverage from outlets across the political spectrum, as did various states easing restrictions. Some voices from the right criticized health leaders' response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

President Joe Biden is expected to make an official announcement Wednesday. Currently, there are about 2,500 U.S. troops in the country, serving alongside 7,000 other foreign troops, most of them part of a NATO coalition. Biden's withdrawal date is later than the May 1 date that the Trump administration agreed on with the Taliban last year; however, troops are expected to begin leaving before the May 1 date and could finish before Sept. 11.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Lower Job Numbers Prompt Debate Over Federal Aid. ARTICLE=> Lower-than-expected hiring numbers in April sparked debate throughout the political world Friday over unemployment, hiring, and the U.S. economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. President Joe Biden reacted by saying the economic recovery has "a long way to go" and framing his recently proposed spending packages as a potential solution. Some on the left said the underwhelming hiring numbers were reason for more targeted government spending to buoy struggling industries and demographics. Many conservatives argued that purportedly over-generous federal unemployment benefits are disincentivizing people from returning to the workforce. Coverage throughout the spectrum Friday focused on the jobs numbers and speculation about causes and solutions. Some perspectives from left-rated sources cited experts who said "investing more in the nation’s workforce" is America's "best shot at replacing some of those jobs and having a qualified pool of labor to fill them." Some voices from right-rated outlets criticized Democrats' willingness to craft large spending packages as a remedy for economic struggles, arguing that "infrastructure spending is totally ineffective as short-term stimulus given its glacially slow spend-out rates."

C-SPAN's livestream of the RNC's first night was seen by roughly 440,000 people; roughly 76,000 saw the DNC's first night on C-SPAN's livestream. Both events saw roughly a 25% decline in total viewership from the first night of the 2016 conventions. Some reports in left-rated sources concentrated on the higher number of DNC viewers. Some coverage from center- and right-rated outlets focused specifically on the C-SPAN numbers, and on the fact that total viewership of the DNC's opening night was down from 2016.

Right-rated outlets generally framed the news as a "major" win for Trump. The New York-based U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling differs from those made in other federal appeals courts, and is unlikely to spur immediate action due to outstanding injunctions in similar cases.

TITLE=> Preview Of Las Vegas Democratic Presidential Debate. ARTICLE=> Six Democratic presidential candidates will face off in a debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, just three days before the Nevada caucuses.

TITLE=> Biden Says U.S. to Reach His Goal of Administering 200 Million COVID-19 Vaccines. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the U.S. is to reach his goal of administering 200 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, which is double Biden's initial goal of administering 100 million doses during his first 100 days in office. Biden extended the goal to 200 million after the U.S. met his initial goal of 100 million doses within approximately 60 days in office. Biden, who will reach 100 days in office net week, also announced tax credits for employers who give employees paid leave to get a vaccine dose. The tax credits are meant for employers with fewer than 500 employees, and were a part of the $1.9 trillion economic relief bill passed last month. Biden also encouraged young people over the age of 18 to sign up to receive the vaccine, days after the administration announced that every American over the age of 16 is now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Currently only two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are available, while the the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines are paused by the CDC due to extremely rare blood clots. The story received consistent coverage across the political spectrum; some right-rated outlets claimed Biden sought to take sole credit for achieving his goal, without crediting the research and development contributions from former President Donald Trump's administration, while left-rated outlets tended to focus more on Biden's speech.
TITLE=> US Ramps Up Vaccine Availability. ARTICLE=> The federal government announced updates to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations Tuesday in an effort to expand access and availability nationwide. Federal health officials are encouraging states to widen vaccination availability to people age 65 or older, and those with chronic health conditions. States won't be required to follow the guidance. The required second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will also be released to states, effectively doubling capacity. President-elect Joe Biden, backed by numerous Democrat governors, requested similar changes last week. The news was covered widely, often framed in the context of rising coronavirus cases. In outlets throughout the spectrum, the new guidelines were reported far less prominently than coverage of the 2020 election and breach of the U.S. Capitol. Some reports from left-rated sources framed the Trump administration's vaccination plan as subpar and distribution as dangerously slow. Some coverage from right-rated outlets credited President Donald Trump for adopting the new guidelines.
TITLE=> Trump Administration Tells Hospitals to Send Coronavirus Data to HHS, Not CDC. ARTICLE=> The Trump Administration has ordered hospitals to bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and send all coronavirus patient information to a central database at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in Washington. Health officials are raising concerns that the data will be politicized or withheld from the public, while HHS says the CDC's system of reporting is slow and inadequate, and that the data will still be made available to the public.
TITLE=> EPA Air Chief Resigns During Ethics Probe. ARTICLE=> The Chief of the Office of Air and Radiation resigned on Wednesday. Bill Wehrum departed during an ethics probe conducted by House Democrats that looked into his former business dealings. The Office is a subsidiary of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

TITLE=> VA Judge Rules Confederate Statues Will Stay. ARTICLE=> Virginia judge Richard E. Moore ruled that two Confederate statues in Charlottesville must remain, citing state historic preservation protections. City council voted to remove the statues of Gens. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson in 2017, but local residents sued in response, saying removal would violate war memorial protections. Ensuing standoffs between groups defending the monument and counter-protesters turned deadly when a man drove his car into counter-demonstrators, killing a 23-year old woman. This story was predominantly covered by the left and center; some commentators on the left framed the ruling as a loss for equality.
TITLE=> Barrett Writes First Supreme Court Major Opinion In Wildlife Protection Case. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government in a lawsuit by an environmental group that sued the Obama administration in 2015 for internal studies detailing potential harm to endangered aquatic species, in the first major opinion penned by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The Sierra Club argued that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to disclose studies about the impact of an Environmental Protection Agency rule detailing how power plants draw water to cool down machinery. Barrett's opinion, which was joined by the five other conservative justices as well as Justice Elena Kagan, said government agencies were protected from FOIA inquires because of the "deliberative process privilege," which means draft documents can be withheld from public view. The case was the first time Barrett took part in oral arguments since she was appointed to the Supreme Court last fall by former President Donald Trump to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented; Breyer wrote that he viewed the "Draft Biological Opinion" as a "final" document, as opposed to "Draft of a Draft Biological Opinion." The story received coverage from outlets across the political spectrum; some noted that Barrett is the first justice since Elena Kagan to write their first majority opinion without the entire court's support.

TITLE=> CNN's Jim Acosta and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders Clash. ARTICLE=> CNN Reporter Jim Acosta and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders engaged in a contentious exchange on Thursday when Acosta pressed Sanders to denounce President Trump's claims that the media is the "enemy of the people." Sanders' supporters argue that the press is unfairly biased against the Trump administration, while Acosta's supporters say that the White House is continuing to foment unjustified anger towards reporters.
TITLE=> Trump References Widely Debunked Theory About Harris. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump mentioned a widely-doubted theory about Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) Thursday at the White House. The theory suggests Harris may be ineligible for the vice presidency because of purported issues with her birth status. Harris was born in Oakland, California, to immigrant parents; being born on U.S. soil qualifies an individual to run for the presidency or vice presidency, according to constitutional precedent. Trump mentioned the theory after being asked about it by a reporter; he detailed the claims that Harris may be ineligible before saying, "I don’t know about that, I just heard about it. I’ll take a look.” Coverage on all sides of the spectrum was notably similar. Journalists on both left and right framed the president's remarks as irresponsible; many left-rated voices, as well as some coverage from left- and center-rated outlets, framed the notion as "racist", and some reports linked the apparent misinformation to what "[Trump] used to power his rise into politics." Coverage from right-rated outlets rarely branded the president's comments as racist, but noted that they were widely refuted by constitutional law experts.
TITLE=> Biden Administration Extends Student Loan Payment Pause to Jan. 2022. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration will extend a pause on federal student loan payments “one final time” to Jan. 31, 2022, the Department of Education announced Friday. The pause began in March 2020 with the CARES Act, was extended to Jan. 2021 by former President Donald Trump, and was extended to the end of Sept. 2021 by President Joe Biden. “As our nation’s economy continues to recover from a deep hole, this final extension will give students and borrowers the time they need to plan for restart and ensure a smooth pathway back to repayment,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement.  Headlines varied across the spectrum on calling the pause a “pause” or a  “freeze.” Some outlets across the spectrum included quotes from Republicans opposed to the extension, and those that did tended to include a quote from Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), who said that “our children will pay the ultimate price for this irresponsible delay.”
TITLE=> Pence Accuses Nike, NBA of Pandering to China. ARTICLE=> Vice President Mike Pence accused the National Basketball Association (NBA) and athletic-wear giant Nike of giving into Chinese pressure following an NBA executive's tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters last month.

China was angered by the since-deleted tweet, and the league initially apologized to anyone who was offended.
TITLE=> Fiona Hill Transcript Details Key White House Meeting, Steele Dossier. ARTICLE=> Impeachment investigators in the House of Representatives released the deposition transcript yesterday of Fiona Hill, former senior director of the National Security Council for Europe and Russia. Hill's testimony touched on a wide range of key events and figures in the controversy, including a July 10 White House meeting at which then-National Security Advisor John Bolton appeared "furious" about efforts by Trump officials to push Ukraine to investigate the president's political rivals. The transcript has become another focal point in the ongoing impeachment investigation. Many news outlets meticulously detailed Hill's claims, which also included her assertion that the now-infamous Steele dossier was a “rabbit hole” that “very likely” contained Russian disinformation.
TITLE=> Kudlow Contradicts Trump, Says US Will Pay For China Tariffs. ARTICLE=> White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow acknowledged on Sunday that China does not directly pay tariffs on goods coming into the U.S., which contradicts President Trump's claims that China will pay for tariffs set by the U.S. Kudlow adds that "both sides will suffer," from this.
TITLE=> Biden Leads Vote Count; Trump Initiates Legal Challenges. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has filed lawsuits alleging fraud and is calling for recounts in several states amid a presidential race that has yet to be decided.

A candidate must gain 270 votes to win the presidency.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Dr. Fauci’s Emails. ARTICLE=> NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci became the focus of media attention again on Tuesday after The Washington Post and BuzzFeed News published thousands of pages of his emails, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The Washington Post obtained 866 pages from March and April 2020, and BuzzFeed News obtained 3,234 pages from January to June 2020. In one email, Fauci said he received “over 1000 e-mails per day and even with staff screening, I do not see them for days." On Thursday, Fauci addressed the coverage of his emails, saying, “The only trouble is they are really ripe to be taken out of context where someone can snip out a sentence in an email without showing the other emails and say, ‘based on an email from Dr. Fauci, he said such-and-such,’ where you don’t really have the full context.” Voices in right-rated outlets tended to accuse Fauci of “flip-flopping” or covering up evidence, and focused on emails regarding the COVID-19 lab leak theory. Voices in left-rated outlets tended to defend Fauci and point to the reported tensions between Fauci and the Trump administration. 
TITLE=> Michael Cohen Testifies Before The House Oversight And Reform Committee. ARTICLE=> President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, calling Trump a conman, racist, and a liar.
TITLE=> New Book by Bob Woodward Alleges 'Administrative Coup D'etat' in the White House. ARTICLE=> Veteran journalist Bob Woodward's new book "Fear" alleges the White House is dealing with an "administrative coup d'etat", including claims that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ignored President Trump's request to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and that Chief of Staff John Kelly called Trump "unhinged" and an "idiot". White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders criticized the veracity of the book, saying it is "nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad."
TITLE=> Perspectives: Thanksgiving Gatherings and Coronavirus Restrictions. ARTICLE=> Amid the surge of COVID-19 coronavirus cases this fall, public health officials are urging Americans to avoid gathering in large groups during Thanksgiving and the rest of the holiday season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against traveling for Thanksgiving this year, while several states including California, Oregon, New Jersey and Iowa placed restrictions on the number of people or households that can gather. Some argue that the holiday should be "canceled" this year for the health and safety of loved ones; others argue that Thanksgiving's connections to American culture and history make celebrating it with loved ones necessary. Outlets across the political spectrum provided guides for having safe Thanksgiving gatherings. Voices from left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the surge in coronavirus cases, the increase in travel ahead of the holiday, while some voices from the right framed the holiday restrictions as a "war on Thanksgiving" and advocated for its celebration.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's First Prime-time Address. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden gave his first prime-time address to the nation on Thursday night. In prepared remarks, Biden announced that the U.S. would have enough vaccine doses for all adults in America by the end of May, and that he is aiming to allow group gatherings by the Fourth of July. Biden also spoke about the importance of wearing a mask and "listening to the science" when making decisions about reopening businesses. Many drew comparisons between Biden's first primetime address, given 50 days into his presidency, and former President Donald Trump's first address, given in August 2017, seven months into his administration. Some voices from the left praised Biden's speech for advocating unity and science, and contrasted Biden's message and tone with Trump's pandemic approach. Many on the right criticized Biden's speech, saying his goals for reopening schools and businesses were too modest, and criticizing him for not crediting his predecessor for accelerating the COVID-19 vaccine development. Some said Biden mentioning issues like masks and science, which Trump was criticized for, was Biden's way of taking a "jab" at Trump without mentioning his name.

TITLE=> Infrastructure Talks Dissolve Between Biden, Senate GOP. ARTICLE=> Bipartisan infrastructure negotiations between the White House and a group of Senate Republicans fell apart Tuesday. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who'd been leading negotiations with President Joe Biden, said the president ended the negotiations on a Tuesday phone call. Biden had recently dropped his infrastructure proposal's price tag from $2.25 trillion to $1 trillion, and the Senate GOP's most recent counteroffer totaled $928 billion; however, the two sides remained too far apart on how to fund the bill and where the majority of the money should be directed. The White House will reportedly now focus on negotiating with a different, bipartisan group of senators. 	The news was featured atop the homepages of many major news sites across the spectrum Tuesday evening. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on funding for non-infrastructure projects included in Biden's proposal, such as climate change and social justice initiatives. Some reports from left-rated source highlighted how Republican infrastructure counteroffers were always significantly smaller than what the Biden administration was advancing.

The package would account for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of payments to the public, industry bailouts and aid for small businesses. Many reporting outlets have tied the efforts to Trump's re-election chances; others, especially on the right, have zoomed in on several of Trump's political opponents who praised the response efforts, including Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).
TITLE=> White House Announces Plan to Distribute 150 Million Rapid COVID-19 Tests. ARTICLE=> The White House announced Monday that it will distribute 150 million rapid COVID-19 tests to states over the next few weeks, including to K-12 schools, nursing homes and assisted living facilities. According to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) statement back in August, the White House entered into a $760 million contract to Abbott Laboratories for delivery of 150 million rapid tests to expand "strategic, evidence-based testing" in the United States. This week, 6.5 million tests will be deployed, and a total of 100 million tests will be distributed to governors based on state population in the next few weeks. While governors will decide where the tests go, the White House is encouraging schools to use the rapid tests to help restart in-person classrooms. Coverage from some left-rated outlets mentioned that this announcement comes a day before the first presidential debates, and after the New York Times released a report examining years of Trump's tax information. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the announcement and the White House's goal of resuming in-person K-12 classrooms.
TITLE=> White House Legal Team Decries Alleged Election Fraud, Projects Trump as Winner. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell led a press conference Thursday, claiming to have proof of a mass conspiracy to elect Joe Biden and manipulate the 2020 presidential election results against Trump. Trump's legal team described him as the election's winner on Thursday; Joe Biden is widely projected to be elected the next president, and there's currently no public evidence of the decisive voter fraud claimed by Trump, Giuliani and others. The conference was covered by outlets on all sides, but particularly left- and center-rated outlets, many of which framed Giuliani's behavior during the event as bizarre. Most left- and center-rated coverage also focused on debunking purportedly inaccurate claims made by Giuliani and others. Right-rated coverage differed. Some reports painted the conference in a neutral light and didn't move to discount the legal team's claims; other voices, such as Fox News' Tucker Carlson, condemned voter fraud while calling on Trump's lawyers to present hard evidence of the election-deciding manipulation they say took place.
TITLE=> US Investigating if Chinese Lab Mismanagement Led to Pandemic. ARTICLE=> U.S. intelligence officials have examined the possibility that the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic originated at a Chinese research lab. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told reporters Tuesday that investigations were so far "inconclusive, although the weight of the evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don’t know for certain;" a Washington Post column published Tuesday morning described State Department warnings made in 2018 about safety protocols at a lab in Wuhan, China, where researchers were studying coronaviruses in bats. Some left-rated outlets focused on Milley's "inconclusive" remark, while some center-rated outlets concentrated more on the evidence apparently pointing to natural occurrence. Conversely, some right-rated outlets painted the lab origination as more likely than not, citing the Post column.
TITLE=> Fox News Says It Does 'Not Condone' Hannity and Pirro Participating in Trump Campaign Rally. ARTICLE=> Fox News rebuked hosts Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro after they appeared on stage at President Trump's Missouri rally on Monday, with the network calling it "an unfortunate distraction" that "has been addressed.” During his speech, Hannity pointed to the media holding area and said,  “All those people in the back are fake news.”
TITLE=> Biden's Budget Pick Met With Resistance From Senate Republicans. ARTICLE=> Projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden's pick for head of the White House budget office, Neera Tanden, was met with resistance from Senate Republicans following Biden's announcement of his economic team on Monday. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that Tanden's nomination will not pass the GOP-controlled Senate. Tanden has frequently clashed with Republican lawmakers on Twitter, though she has since appeared to delete many of her tweets, and has also purportedly sparred with progressive Democrats in the past. She's currently the president of the left-rated Center for American Progress think tank and former policy director for the first Obama-Biden campaign. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight Tanden's career history and the fact that she would be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to lead the budget office if confirmed. Coverage from center- and right-rated outlets tended to highlight her interactions and clashes with members of both parties.

The bill sparked controversy along the ideological spectrum. Some 2020 Democrats like the idea, but none discussed concrete plans for its execution. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has been outspoken against the bill, saying that "none of us currently living are responsible." The idea of reparations is not popular among voters. The majority of voters (68%) say they do not support cash reparations to descendants of slaves. About 1 in every 3 African American voters do not support reparations; about 8 in 10 white voters do not support reparations.

TITLE=> Fauci Doesn't Expect Lockdowns Amid Delta Variant Outbreak. ARTICLE=> Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said during an interview on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday that he doesn't "think we're going to see lockdowns" to prevent the spread of COVID-19 amid the spread of the Delta variant.  While the health official believes that an adequate percentage of Americans have been vaccinated to avoid lockdowns, he warned that "things will get worse" in the coming months. "Not enough to crush the outbreak, but I believe enough to not allow us to get into the situation we were in last winter," he said. The 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. was at 79,763 on Sunday, over a 500% increase from the month before. Some headlines highlighted Fauci's comments that dismissed the idea of another lockdown; others ran with the health official's warning that the country’s latest COVID-19 surge is going to get worse. The majority of outlets seemed to agree that most of the new infections are coming from unvaccinated people. Editor's Note: This summary was updated at 12:46 p.m. on 8/2/21 for clarity. Our original summary insinuated that there had been a national lockdown, when that was not the case.

TITLE=> US Catholic Bishops to Prepare Document That May Deny Biden Communion. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) voted Friday to draft a statement regarding the Eucharist after much debate surrounding whether President Joe Biden and other Catholic lawmakers who support abortion are eligible to receive communion. The conference voted 168 to 55, with six abstentions, to draft the statement over the summer and present for edits in November. CNN reported that the statement is expected to include a portion with an admonition to Catholic politicians who "disobey church teaching on abortion and other core doctrinal issues." When asked Thursday whether Biden is eligible to receive communion, the chairman of the USCCB doctrine committee said the committee must examine "Eucharistic consistency." Biden, the second Catholic president in U.S. history, voted against abortion rights bills for most of his career until he dropped his support for the 1977 Hyde Amendment in 2019 and pledged to codify Roe v. Wade during his 2020 presidential campaign.  The story received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated outlets highlighted quotes from Catholics who favor abortion rights, as well as data reporting that more than half of U.S. Catholics support abortion and think Biden should receive communion. Some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted both sides of the debate Thursday from Catholic bishops and officials; most framed Biden's abortion stance in a negative light. 
TITLE=> Sessions Expands Civil Asset Forfeiture. ARTICLE=> Jeff Sessions is expanding a program that allows police officers to seize property from individuals who are suspected of a crime, but have not yet been convicted. The controversial practice, known as civil asset forfeiture, had been reduced under the Obama administration. Proceeds from the practice are often used to fund law enforcement agencies, and many people across the aisle argue that it constitutes an abuse of power.
TITLE=> Operation Warp Speed Adviser Predicts A COVID-19 Vaccine By Mid-December. ARTICLE=> On Sunday Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's plan to administer a COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine, said some Americans could start receiving a vaccine by the second week of December. Slaoui's comments come after pharmaceutical company Pfizer applied for emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Slaoui said with a 95 percent effective rate, about 70 percent of the population would have to be immunized "for true herd immunity to take place"; Slaoui said he expects this to take place in May 2021. The potential vaccine was widely covered by outlets across the political spectrum. Coverage from right-rated sources tended to be more optimistic, highlighting Slaoui's hopes of herd immunity by next year. Reports from left-rated outlets tended to mention the fact that Trump has yet to recognize Biden as the winner of the election, subsequently inhibiting Biden's strategy for battling the coronavirus.
TITLE=> Perspectives: How Should The US Prioritize Booster Shots?. ARTICLE=> Following the CDC's approval of a third shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those 65 and older or who are at high risk, many Americans remain divided on how the nation should administer booster shots moving forward. The U.S. has been taking notes from Israel's booster shot rollout that launched on Aug. 29, which made the third vaccine dose available for vaccinated individuals 12 and older. One study conducted at an Israeli hospital found that antibody counts in the body after a third dose were about 10 times higher than after a second dose. Israel said its booster shot strategy has helped combat the highly infectious Delta variant, and commended the U.S. for approving the shots for certain adults. “The main question now is of prioritization,” said Israeli public health official Dr. Nadav Davidovitch. After the World Health Organization called for a moratorium on booster shots until the end of the year to help other countries, some health officials across the globe have called for more evidence to justify giving booster shots to most Americans.  Voices across the spectrum questioned the booster shot rollout, but opinions diverged on how to administer them. Some right-rated voices believe that individuals "more at risk of severe illness should have the booster option" and that Americans should be prioritized before other nations. Some outlets noted how "it’s not a zero-sum game," suggesting that the U.S. can do both by ramping up vaccine production through "accelerated technology" and utilizing international alliances. Left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight criticism from the scientific community that points to the "extreme global vaccine inequity." Some also fear that the CDC's narrowing of Biden's initial plan will result in more vaccine hesitancy across the country.

TITLE=> Bipartisan Group of Senators Reaches Tentative Agreement on Infrastructure Deal to Present to Biden. ARTICLE=> A bipartisan group of ten senators released a statement Thursday saying they reached an agreement on framework for an infrastructure deal. The statement said the bill will be fully paid for and exclude any tax hikes, but did not release details regarding funding; according to the New York Times, the bill is expected to address core physical infrastructure projects and will cost $1.2 trillion over eight years, and include $579 billion in new spending. In the statement, the group said they are discussing their "approach with our respective colleagues and the White House." It is unclear whether the group has any support from key leaders in either party. This comes after President Joe Biden ended negotiation talks with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito on Tuesday.  The story received similar coverage from across the spectrum.

TITLE=> DOJ Watchdog Will Investigate Trump-Era Leak Probe Into Dem Lawmakers. ARTICLE=> The Justice Department's inspector general will probe how the department managed a Trump-era investigation into media leaks that involved the secret seizure of data for some Democratic lawmakers, their staff and family members. News emerged this week of Justice Department investigations of House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) during the leak probes in 2017 and 2018, which involved seizures of their Apple data. The alleged leaks reportedly involved classified information about correspondence between the Trump administration and the Russian government. 	Coverage of the news was featured prominently by many major left- and center-rated outlets Friday afternoon; many right-rated outlets hadn't offered original reporting on the news at the time of this writing. Some reports from right-rated sources concentrated on the source of the leaks in question, echoing statements on the story from Republican lawmakers. Some coverage from left-rated sources focused on Democrats' calls for former attorneys general Jeff Sessions and William Barr to testify about the probes in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
TITLE=> Gas Prices Reach 7-Year High. ARTICLE=> The price of gasoline in the United States is up 58% from this time last year and is at its highest point since 2014, according to AAA. As of Thursday, the average price of a gallon of gas was $3.04. Prices were already on the rise when the Colonial Pipeline, which transports roughly 45% of the East Coast's fuel supply, shut down for roughly a week after being hacked earlier this month. The shutdown led to significant gas shortages across over a dozen mid-Atlantic and southeastern states. 	The news was covered across the spectrum, but was highlighted more prominently by right-rated sources. Some reports from right-rated outlets suggested that President Biden's clean energy agenda deserved blame for the spike in prices, and focused on former President Donald Trump's criticisms of the situation. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources tended to frame the price rise as a consequence of the pipeline hack. Outlets on all sides connected the high prices to Memorial Day weekend and the fact that many Americans will be traveling.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Divides on Public Health Measures as Pandemic Ends. ARTICLE=> As the COVID-19 pandemic comes to a close, people remain split on continued public health restrictions, including mask-wearing and social distancing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines earlier this month saying vaccinated people could ditch the facemask in most situations; the vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are between 65 and 95% effective, based on clinical trials. Governments in 20 states, as well as Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., still require masks in most indoor public settings.  Voices are divided across the spectrum. Some left-rated voices say that they're not yet ready to stop wearing facemasks, citing the lack of 100% vaccine effectiveness and arguing that wearing a mask "says to those around us that, whatever our vaccine status, we value community safety." Some right-rated voices highlighted positive data about infection rates and the vaccine rollout, and said overbearing public health restrictions and guidance had "paralyzed the nation with fear." Other voices advocated for a combination of informed caution and willing return to normalcy. Last week, AllSides explored more about polarization around masks and vaccines in our Perspectives section.

TITLE=> Happy Fourth of July 2018. ARTICLE=> Today marks the 242nd year of independence for America on what is expected to be a steamy day in much of the country.
TITLE=> Jobless Claims Fall to Another Pandemic Low. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans who filed jobless claims last week fell to 473,000, a new low during the COVID-19 pandemic as businesses reopen and fewer employers are cutting jobs. The number remains more than twice as high as it was before the pandemic.  Though job openings are at a record 8.1 million and nearly 10 million people are officially unemployed, companies are struggling to find employees.  Economists cite several factors keeping workers at home, including expanded $300 unemployment benefits, individuals’ fear of contracting the virus, and child-care burdens due to school closures.  Those constraints could ease in the hall as supplemental jobless benefits end and more schools reopen.
TITLE=> Remembering Our Veterans - Veterans Day 2019. ARTICLE=> On Veterans Day, we pause to remember the men and women who have bravely served in the United States Armed Forces. On June 4, 1926, the United States Congress called for the observance of November 11th with appropriate ceremonies, and an official act creating the holiday was approved on May 13, 1938.
TITLE=> Top Democrats Leave Meeting with Trump on Syria Prematurely. ARTICLE=> Top Congressional Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walked out of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, claiming he had a "meltdown" and went on a "nasty diatribe." White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president was "measured, factual and decisive," and said the Democrats went "in front of cameras to whine." Trump has not publicly commented; the meeting followed a House vote that condemned Trump's removal of U.S. forces from northern Syria, 354-60. Outlets on the right side of the political spectrum tended to mention the statements from the White House and other Republicans more prominently in their coverage.

Some voices, including those of world leaders, advocated for universally equal vaccine access.
TITLE=> North Korea Nuclear Test. ARTICLE=> Early today, North Korea tested what they claim to be a hydrogen bomb, a powerful nuclear weapon. This is not their first nuclear test, but the device was much more powerful than the last one they tested. This test comes amid a time of high tensions among North Korea and the rest of the world as  North Korea has run several missile tests in the last few months.
TITLE=> Uncle of Stephen Miller Calls Him an "Immigration Hypocrite" in New Op-ed. ARTICLE=> The uncle of Trump aide Stephen Miller called his nephew an "immigration hypocrite" in a scathing op-ed for Politico, saying their family would have been "wiped out" had Miller's ideas on immigration been implemented at the time. Critics of the argument say that policy cannot be decided on the mere basis of family benefit.
TITLE=> Biden Orders Intelligence Agencies to Report on COVID-19 Origins Within 90 Days. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he had directed intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to come closer to a definitive conclusion on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and to “report back to me in 90 days.” The announcement came days after the Wall Street Journal reported on an intelligence report stating that three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in November 2019, reigniting speculation around the theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab. Biden explained that the intelligence community was considering the theory as one of “two likely scenarios” with “low or moderate confidence,” but that it had not reached a definitive conclusion. “The majority of [intelligence community] elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other,” Biden said. Coverage tended to discuss similar quotes and facts about the story regardless of bias rating. Some right-rated outlets featured the story with opinion content criticizing media and Democratic political figures for disregarding the Wuhan lab theory. 
TITLE=> U.S. to Ban Imports From China's Xinjiang Region, Citing Forced Labor. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a ban on all cotton and tomato imports from western China’s Xinjiang region due to allegations that they are made with forced labor from detained Uighur Muslims, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Xinjiang accounts for nearly 20% of global cotton production; the U.S. imported $9 billion in cotton products and $10 million in tomatoes from China last year. “Imports made on the cheap by using forced labor hurt American businesses that respect human rights and also expose unsuspecting consumers to unethical purchases,” CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said in the statement. The Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act is up for consideration in the Senate; the proposal would ban all products imported from Xinjiang unless customs officials verify the product was made without forced labor. Coverage from center- and left-rated outlets tended to frame the story as an effort by the Trump administration to harden the U.S.' economic standing against Beijing, and provided speculation about how Biden would respond to the China-U.S. relationship once he takes office. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight the CBP's remarks on forced labor.
TITLE=> House Removes Marjorie Taylor Greene From Committees. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House of Representatives voted to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) from the Education and Budget committees on Thursday evening. Led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House voted 230-199, with 11 Republicans joining every Democrat, to remove Greene because of social media activity in support of conspiracy theories, bigotry, and violence, including violence against Pelosi. In a floor speech on Thursday afternoon, Greene backtracked some of her previous statements, saying she believed school shootings are “real” and “9/11 absolutely happened” after expressing skepticism over both the 9/11 terrorist attack and the Sandy Hook elementary school and Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School shootings. “These were words of the past and these things do not represent me,” Greene said, claiming the media distorted her views, and equating the media to conspiracy group QAnon. In a Wednesday meeting with House Republicans, Greene also apologized for having subscribed to some QAnon conspiracy theories. The story received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on Greene's past comments; some left-rated outlets highlight the fact that Greene did not apologize for her comments. Some right-rated outlets tended to highlight remarks from GOP members who warned that removing Greene by majority vote would set a dangerous precedent for the House.
TITLE=> Trump Warns Puerto Rico. ARTICLE=> US President Donald Trump has complained about emergency relief efforts in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying federal aid cannot continue "forever".
TITLE=> Ben Carson to Revise Obama-Era Fair Housing Rule. ARTICLE=> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson announced plans to roll back an Obama-era fair housing rule which required local governments that received HUD funding to assess and break down discriminatory barriers in housing markets.

TITLE=> Debt Deal with Democrats. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump stunned Republicans on Wednesday when he sided with Democrats on a proposal to attach emergency aid for Hurricane Harvey victims to measures to keep the government funded and its borrowing limit suspended until mid-December.
TITLE=> Texas Governor Launches Texas Border Wall Construction With Donations, $250 Million Down Payment. ARTICLE=> Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Wednesday that Texas would build its own border wall with a $250 million down payment from Texas' Department of Criminal Justice to begin. “Building the wall in Texas has officially begun,” Abbott said during the press conference, saying construction was going on “as we speak.” Abbott said the wall will be partly funded by donations, and would be built on a combination of "volunteer land", or privately donated property, and state land. Abbott also encouraged people to donate to a website to help fund the border wall. This comes after President Joe Biden halted the southern border wall construction shortly after he took office; more than 450 miles of wall, including in Texas, had been built under the Trump administration. On Tuesday, former President Donald Trump said he “accepted the invitation” from Abbott to tour Texas' border wall on June 30. Last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 180,000 encounters with migrants along the southern border.  The story received coverage from across the spectrum. Coverage from the right and center tended to focus on the details of Abbott's plan and the history of border wall construction in recent years. Some outlets on the left tended to highlight comments from advocacy groups calling the border wall "immoral" and criticizing Abbott for asking for donations and focusing on the border wall instead of helping Texans recover from the winter storms earlier this year.

TITLE=> Judge Rules Cuccinelli Appointment Illegal. ARTICLE=> A federal judge ruled that the appointment of Ken Cuccinelli to head United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA). Cuccinelli had occupied two positions; director of the USCIS and deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, for which he was never confirmed by the Senate. Rules implemented by Cuccinelli during his stint may also be nullified. Senate Republicans had reportedly warned the White House that bypassing Senate confirmation and having Cuccinelli serve both roles simultaneously would be illegal.
TITLE=> Sen. Cory Booker Releases 'Confidential' Kavanaugh Documents. ARTICLE=> Democratic Sen. Cory Booker on Thursday released a series of documents he claimed were confidential relating to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying “this is the closest I’ll get to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment.” The move evoked wide criticism from Senate Republicans, prompting them to point out that the emails in question had already been approved for release. Booker then introduced additional documents on Thursday night that were still marked "committee confidential", violating Senate rules. Many on the Right have said that Booker is merely grandstanding for a potential presidential run, while some on the Left have argued that he is effectively standing up to Trump.
TITLE=> Biden, Warren Campaigns Show Signs of Slowing Down. ARTICLE=> After the first two Democratic primaries of the 2020 election cycle, two notable campaigns sparked commentary from all sides of the political spectrum—the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and former Vice President Joe Biden (DE). Warren is part of the left wing of the party, with Biden occupying the moderate lane. Both have previously polled as national front runners, yet both failed to capture any delegates at the New Hampshire Primary. This has raised questions about the future of each campaign going forward.
TITLE=> Legal Decisions on Ballot Counting Deadlines Draw Differences Between States. ARTICLE=> Separate court rulings this week drew stark differences among states in determining how mail-in votes would be counted in the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court ruled that Pennsylvania and North Carolina could count mail-in votes past Election Day on Nov. 3. Pennsylvania will count ballots received up until Nov. 6, and North Carolina will accept ballots until Nov. 12. In Minnesota, an appeals court ruled that mail-in ballots must be received by Nov. 3 to be counted. Coverage from throughout the spectrum focused on all three states' cases, and President Donald Trump's subsequent statement that "the Election should END on November 3." Reports from right-rated sources tended to focus on the Minnesota case; some referred to it as a Democratic Party "scheme." Some coverage from left- and center-rated sources focused on the Supreme Court rulings as rejections of Republican-led efforts.
TITLE=> Last US Troops Depart Hub of Afghanistan Operations. ARTICLE=> The last U.S. troops will leave Bagram Airfield near Kabul, Afghanistan in the coming days, ending operations at what served as the U.S. military's hub in the country for roughly two decades. The move will leave fewer than 1,000 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan reportedly met Afghani President Ashraf Ghani Friday to discuss "continued assistance and co-operation." Meanwhile, reports across the spectrum suggest that Taliban militants are gaining strength throughout the country The news made headlines across the spectrum Friday; many news sources on all sides republished the same in-depth report from the Associated Press. Both left- and right-rated outlets framed the U.S. departure in the context of rising Taliban advances across Afghanistan and concerns about the Afghan government's ability to defend itself. Other reports, particularly from the right, highlighted President Joe Biden's exchange with reporters who inquired about the news on Friday, in which he criticized their questioning as "negative."

Coverage on all sides focused on the president's comments, the talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin, and details about more direct stimulus relief payments. Some coverage from left-rated sources framed Trump and Republicans as being to blame for the lack of more relief; some coverage from right-rated outlets painted Pelosi and Democrats in a similarly negative light.

TITLE=> Health Experts Speculate About Herd Immunity In The U.S.. ARTICLE=> Nearly one year into widespread COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, vaccine rollouts and a decline in new cases have health experts speculating about when the country will reach herd immunity. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, surgeon and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine professor Marty Makary said he believes herd immunity to the virus would be when 60% to 80% have been infected or vaccinated, and that the U.S. could reach the number by April. According to Makary, about 8% of the population has been infected and 15% of the population vaccinated; additionally, he said, since many COVID-19 cases are not recorded because not everyone gets tested, he estimated the real number is possibly 55%, and that the 60% threshold could be reached by April. Others warn that herd immunity depends on several factors that vary by region, such as restrictions, vaccination rate and infection rate. In addition, some warn it is still unknown how long immunity from vaccines will last or how current vaccines will protect against new variants of the virus. On Sunday, former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS he thinks the U.S. may never reach full herd immunity against the virus, saying "Covid is going to continue to circulate at a low level." Some outlets across the political spectrum provided analysis as to when herd immunity could be achieved. Makary's op-ed received wide coverage from the right and less coverage from left- and center-rated outlets, though it was covered by Mediaite and Newsweek.

Most right-rated sources and voices concentrated on what supposedly led to Booker's failure.
TITLE=> Wisconsin Supreme Court Strikes Down Governor's Emergency Order Mask Mandate. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, Wisconsin's Supreme Court voted 4-3 to strike down Gov. Tony Evers' statewide mask mandate, and blocked him from issuing any new public health emergency orders without the approval of the Republican-majority state legislature. This ruling comes after Evers, a Democrat, repeatedly attempted to issue a mask mandate by using emergency declarations, despite Republican lawmakers' claim that he is overreaching. In February, the Wisconsin General Assembly repealed Evers' emergency order and statewide mask mandate, citing Evers' abuse of emergency powers; after that, Evers signed a new emergency order mask mandate just an hour later. Evers encouraged state residents in a statement to continue following COVID-19 precautions. The decision in Wisconsin comes a day after Arkansas lifted a statewide mask mandate, joining a handful of states that have lifted mask mandates this month, including Texas, Mississippi, Iowa, North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. The story received coverage across the political spectrum. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight Republican pushback against Evers, while some left-rated outlets tended to highlight polls reporting that most Wisconsin residents trusted Evers with COVID-19 precautions.

TITLE=> Split Research, Opinions on Whether Protests Caused Virus Spike. ARTICLE=> Research into whether recent protests caused a spike in COVID-19 coronavirus cases is emerging in various regions throughout the U.S., often with different conclusions. Reactions of leaders and health officials to protests following the death of George Floyd are being contrasted with the same officials' reactions to anti-lockdown protests months earlier; a New York Times story published Monday highlights how some health experts admitted advocating for participation in Black Lives Matter protests while warning of the health risks associated with anti-lockdown protests. The subject has been reported on more by right-rated sources, many of which focused on data that suggests protests led to rises in virus cases and increased public safety risks. Some coverage from left- and center-rated outlets framed that focus as misguided, pointing to apparently contradictory data. Other coverage from some left-rated sources explored the possibility that the protests helped stop the virus from spreading.
TITLE=> DOJ Labels Portland, Seattle and New York “Anarchist Jurisdictions”. ARTICLE=> Following instructions from President Donald Trump earlier this month, the Department of Justice on Monday labeled Portland, Seattle and New York City as “anarchist jurisdictions” and threatened to withhold federal funding. The three cities in question made cuts to their police budgets this year. In a statement on the move, Attorney General William Barr said: “When state and local leaders impede their own law enforcement officers and agencies from doing their jobs, it endangers innocent citizens who deserve to be protected.” It is unclear which funds will potentially be cut, but New York City alone receives about $7 billion in federal funds annually. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to include New York crime statistics and a quote from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo saying, “[Trump] better have an army if he thinks he’s gonna walk down the street in New York.” Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to include the use of federal agents against protesters and rioters in some cities, including Portland.

Murphy was sent a formal resolution calling for his impeachment Tuesday after $50,000 in student fees were spent on Donald Trump Jr. and campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle's visit to campus last month.

Coverage from right-rated sources focused more on Republicans' criticism of the Democrats' opposition.

The police chief, Tim Gannon, resigned stating that he believed  "it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately."

In a Medium post and email to supporters, O'Rourke said his "service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee." O'Rourke's withdrawal received broad media coverage, with many outlets noting that the once-rising Democratic star had failed to recapture the energy of his 2018 Senate bid against Republican U.S. Representative Ted Cruz. Several focused on comments by President Donald Trump, who called O'Rourke a "poor bastard" at his rally in Mississippi.
TITLE=> Conflicting Reports on Release of New CDC Guidelines. ARTICLE=> An Associated Press report published Thursday said the White House had benched new CDC coronavirus guidelines, suggesting the administration was furthering its perceived attempts to be the coronavirus information and guidance gatekeeper. Several White House officials pushed back on the AP report, saying the CDC had not yet cleared the guidelines for public release and that editing was still ongoing. Left-rated outlets generally focused more on the notion that the Trump administration suppressed the guidelines to assert more control over the flow of coronavirus instruction; right-rated outlets focused more on the fact that states can still access the guidelines if they contact the CDC. Some in the center focused on reports that White House officials refused to sign off on the guidelines because they purportedly obstructed religious freedom.
TITLE=> Senator Murkowski "Disturbed" Over Coordination With White House On Impeachment Trial.

ARTICLE=> On Sunday, a man wearing a FedEx driver's uniform killed the son and wounded the husband of US District Judge Esther Salas at their home at North Brunswick, New Jersey.

TITLE=> Cuomo Releases Statement Amid Sexual Harassment Claims; NY Preps Probe. ARTICLE=> New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press release Sunday that he was "truly sorry about" previous comments he made that "have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation." Two former aides, Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett, have accused the third-term governor of sexual harassment, alleging inappropriate comments and unwanted touching. Cuomo denied allegations of inappropriate touching; "At work sometimes I think I am being playful and make jokes that I think are funny," said Cuomo in the press release. "I do, on occasion, tease people in what I think is a good natured way." New York Attorney General Letitia James is leading an independent investigation of the governor's conduct. The news made major headlines across the spectrum, especially on the right. Most reports acknowledged that the claims, as well as the Cuomo administration's alleged cover-up of nursing home deaths, threaten to push him from office. Some left-rated outlets focused more on the apologetic nature of Cuomo's press release. Some right-rated outlets framed the release as an non-remorseful explanation rather than a sincere apology.
TITLE=> FBI Investigating After Hospital Worker Allegedly Ruined 500 Vaccine Doses on Purpose. ARTICLE=> An employee at a Grafton, Wisconsin hospital was fired after allegedly spoiling 500 doses of the COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine on purpose last week. The move was initially considered an accident, but the worker reportedly confessed. Local police say the FBI and Food and Drug Administration are investigating. No motive has been announced publicly, and no other employees are suspected of involvement. The news was covered prominently and similarly by news outlets on all sides of the spectrum. Few reports, if any, were overly speculative. Not all coverage mentioned the FBI investigation.
TITLE=> Trump Names North Korea a State Sponsor of Terrorism.

TITLE=> Sexual Assault Investigation into Julian Assange to be Reopened, Swedish Prosecutor Says. ARTICLE=> Swedish prosecutor Marie Persson indicated, Monday morning, that probable cause has been established in a rape case against WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Britain is faced with a choice of whether to extradite Assange to the Swedish or the Americans after serving his 50-week jail sentence for violating his bail conditions. The investigation into Assange was initially suspended in 2017; extradition was unlikely with his political asylum from Ecuador, where he stayed in an embassy in London.
TITLE=> Biden Releases $1.52 Trillion 2022 Federal Budget Proposal. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration on Friday proposed a $1.52 trillion federal discretionary spending budget for fiscal year 2022. The budget includes a 1.7% increase in military spending and a 16% increase in non-defense spending, marking a substantial shift from previous administrations. News coverage often focused on specific spending proposals, such as a 10.4% increase in the IRS budget, a 12% increase in the State Department’s budget, $1.4 billion for environmental justice initiatives, $1.2 billion for “border security technology,” $0 for border wall construction, $861 million in targeted aid to Central America, $10 billion for global health programs, and $14 billion for fighting climate change. By Friday evening, various parts of Biden’s budget had attracted criticism from both the left and the right, particularly on military spending. Federal discretionary spending totaled $1.3 trillion in 2019 and $1.4 trillion in 2020. Coverage varied widely across the spectrum, with coverage often focusing on specific parts of the budget. There were no major noticeable differences in coverage between left- and right-rated outlets as of Friday evening.
TITLE=> House Overrides Trump's Defense Bill Veto. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House voted 322-87 Monday to override President Donald Trump's veto of the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act. The bill includes funding for military programs, construction projects, a 3% pay raise for military, and renaming of military bases named for Confederate generals. In a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Trump said he vetoed the $740 billion annual defense spending bill because the bill "includes language that would require the renaming of certain military installations"; Trump also criticized the bill for potentially restricting the president's ability to withdraw troops, and criticized lawmakers’ refusal to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The bill will now move to a GOP-majority Senate. The story received coverage from all sides of the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Macron Awards Grants to US Climate Scientists. ARTICLE=> Emmanuel Macron is awarding "Make our Planet Great Again" grants to 13 US scientists that will fund relocation to France and climate research for several years.
TITLE=> Biden Seeks $30 Billion For Disaster Aid And Resettlement Of Afghan Refugees. ARTICLE=> The White House budget office sent an "urgent" letter to Congress on Tuesday requesting at least $30 billion to fund natural disaster aid and the resettlement of Afghan refugees. At least $10 billion would be used to help states recover from Hurricane Ida, while another $14 billion would be allocated for other natural disasters such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. $6.4 billion of the package would be used to fund the processing and relocation of tens of thousands of Afghans who helped the United States during the two-decade war in Afghanistan. Shalanda Young, the White House Office of Management and Budget acting director, also asked Congress to attach the funds to a stopgap measure in order to avoid a partial government shutdown on Oct. 1. Coverage on this topic did not differ much across partisan lines. Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how the stopgap measure would "only temporarily keep the government funded through late November or December." Left-rated outlets were more likely to mention "climate change" in their reporting, pointing to the increased number of extreme storms and disasters over the last number of months.
TITLE=> Following Conventions, Some Presidential Polling Numbers Conflict. ARTICLE=> Following each party's 2020 presidential election conventions, attention has shifted back to polling numbers and how the public views President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Some reports from left- and center-rated outlets have focused on data that suggests Trump's favorability is stagnant, framing the alleged inertia in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and pushes for racial justice. Some right-rated voices have concentrated on polls that suggest Trump is gaining ground, mainly a recent poll from Emerson College, a trend purportedly due in part to rising support among minority voters and Biden and the Democratic Party's alleged softness on ongoing violence amid protests for racial justice. Significant reporting on all sides has also focused on comparing Trump and Biden among battleground state voters.
TITLE=> ExxonMobil Wins Landmark N.Y. Climate Fraud Case. ARTICLE=> A New York Supreme Court judge ruled Tuesday that the state's attorney general failed to find convincing evidence of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil lying about the financial affects it may face from potential climate change-related regulations. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets focused on the case's potential to set precedent as one of the first cases of potential climate change fraud to reach trial in the United States; right-rated outlets focused more on apparent holes in the state's case, referencing N.Y's drop of two additional claims at the end of the trial in November.
TITLE=> FCC Votes to Overturn Net Neutrality Regulations. ARTICLE=> The Federal Communications Commission voted to overturn Obama-era net neutrality regulations that were put in place to ensure a free and open internet.

Several animal rights groups have also opposed the measure, saying it doesn't go far enough.
TITLE=> President Trump Brushes Off Concerns Of Recession. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump, along with his top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, have offered an optimistic outlook of the economy, dismissing worries of a recession.

TITLE=> Bolton to Publish Memoir Despite National Security Fears. ARTICLE=> Judge Royce Lambert ruled in favor of former national security advisor John Bolton to proceed with the publication of his memoir on Saturday, despite the White House's efforts to block it for national security reasons. Though Lambert ruled in Bolton's favor, he criticized Bolton in the ruling for "[gambling] with the national security of the United States." Some voices from the right criticized the risk in publishing the book and claimed Bolton used sensationalized language. Several voices from the left pointed to this ruling as a victory for freedom of speech and expression.
TITLE=> Protesters Tear Down Confederate Statue at UNC. ARTICLE=> Protesters toppled a Confederate statue at the University of North Carolina known as Silent Sam, reigniting debate around the controversial monuments.

TITLE=> Too Few Votes to Repeal ACA. ARTICLE=> It became apparent today that GOP leaders lacked the votes to abolish parts of the 2010 law outright. Three centrist Republican senators — Susan Collins (Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — all said they would oppose any vote to proceed with an immediate repeal of the law.
TITLE=> Trump Rolls Out 'Platinum Plan' for Black Communities. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Donald Trump rolled out his Platinum Plan, which designates $500 billion for black communities and entrepreneurs to increase capital access and promises to open 500,000 new black businesses and 3 million jobs for black Americans. The plan also recognizes Juneteenth as an official holiday, and promises to “prosecute the KKK and ANTIFA as terrorist organizations and make lynching a national hate crime.” It also includes provisions for education and religious organizations in black communities; the president will also work on a Second Step Act and a National Clemency Program, though little detail is provided. In a speech on Friday at the “Black Voices for Trump” rally in the unexpected battleground state of Georgia, Trump told the audience that Democrats "take the black vote for granted," before stating, “I did more for the Black community in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years." Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the Platinum Plan. Some left- and center-rated outlets tended to frame the story as Trump's effort to gain black voters; several left-rated reports also left out details of Trump's plan, such as the terrorist designations and the Second Step Act.
TITLE=> Fake News Accusations Surround Trump's 'Home Alone 2' Cameo. ARTICLE=> Chris Columbus' classic 1992 Christmas comedy 'Home Alone 2: Lost In New York' triggered a feverish media controversy this week after it was discovered that an iconic cameo by President Donald Trump was cut from a Canadian broadcast of the movie. Many conservative outlets and critics cast the move as an example of politically-motivated media bias, while Trump himself insinuated in a tweet that the decision to remove the scene came from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the company behind the broadcast, said Thursday that it made the cut in 2014 to make room for commercials. The confirmation elicited an apology from at least one conservative commentator, Fox News host Katie Pavlich, who had earlier accused the company of "censorship."
TITLE=> Opinion: Identity Politics Backfires. ARTICLE=> In this highly divisive election, many editorials pointed out the problem of identity politics, how it causes problems for the Democratic Party, worsens race relations and belittles many other segments of Americans, if not everyone. Some saw it as a key driving force that backfired against Democrats and Hillary Clinton to elect Donald Trump. Some called for an end to identity liberalism. Others identified using a dominant identify to define a group of people as a crude way to dehumanize people and a core component of racism.
TITLE=> Pence Remarks Linking Soleimani To 9/11 Come Under Scrutiny. ARTICLE=> A tweet by Vice President Mike Pence connecting General Qasem Soleimani to the 9/11 terrorist attacks drew criticism from some media outlets on Friday, the same day a U.S. drone strike killed the top Iranian official. Defending the administration's decision, Pence said Soleimani "assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks." Left and right media outlets were clearly divided over the accuracy of the remarks, with many in the former camp characterizing them as "dubious" and "unsubstantiated." No right-rated outlets had covered the comments as of this writing, though the Washington Times did report that the 9/11 commission found "strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11."
TITLE=> Biden and Congressional Democrats Introduce Immigration Bill. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, President Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats will unveil an immigration bill, known as the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, that would offer an eight-year pathway to citizenship to an estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status. Proponents say the bill would increase legal immigration levels and cancel penalties for future unauthorized immigrants. Critics say the bill backtracks on needed border security measures and worksite enforcement compromises.
TITLE=> Repeal Revival?. ARTICLE=> With talk of changes to the repeal and replace healthcare plan, will Republicans move to vote on the AHCA II?
TITLE=> Taliban Victories Raise Fears of Complete Afghanistan Takeover. ARTICLE=> Recent Taliban victories in Afghanistan have displaced thousands and raised fears of a complete Taliban takeover. An E.U. official said Tuesday that the Taliban had taken 65% of the country, and U.S. intelligence officials reportedly believe that Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, could fall to the Taliban within 90 days. The warnings came as the Taliban took control of six provincial capital cities within four days; many of these advances were reportedly met with little resistance from Afghan security forces.  President Joe Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces on Tuesday, saying, “Afghan leaders have to come together. We lost thousands … of American personnel. They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation. The United States will insist we continue to keep the commitments we made: providing close air support, making sure that their Air Force functions and is operable, resupplying their forces with food and equipment, and paying all their salaries. But they’ve got to want to fight.” Coverage was widespread across the spectrum on Wednesday and more prominently featured in internationally focused outlets like BBC News and Foreign Policy. Several headlines across the spectrum cut Biden’s full quote down to “they’ve got to fight for themselves.” Only left- and center-rated outlets published original coverage of this story as reported by their correspondents in Afghanistan.
TITLE=> Perspective: Polling Errors and Media Mistakes Leading Up to 2020 Election. ARTICLE=> Issues with national polling methodology and overall media attitudes have become a prominent side story as 2020 election results begin to wind down. Many national opinion polls projected former Vice President Joe Biden to beat President Donald Trump by a significant margin in the presidential election, and gave the Democratic Party a good chance of taking control of the U.S. Senate and improving their representation in the House of Representatives. Conversely, Biden leads Trump by a close margin in the presidential race, and Republicans seem poised to keep their Senate majority and add seats to their House total as of Friday evening. Voices on all sides have focused criticism on the mainstream media and national pollsters; pollsters for collecting poor data and failing to learn from 2016's mistakes, and the media for purportedly following the narrative set by the polls instead of doing thorough journalism. Some right-rated voices expressed more pessimism about the media's ability to correct its alleged failures and better mitigate political bias.
TITLE=> FDA to Meet to Consider Pfizer-BioNTech Emergency Coronavirus Vaccine Authorization. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will meet Thursday to discuss emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine. A vote could come after the advisory committee, the FDA and vaccine experts hear the companies' presentations and participate in a Q&A session. Some FDA officials and advisory committee members predicted the vaccines would receive approval since trial results show the vaccine to be 95% effective, which meets the FDA's required 50 percent. If approved, distribution is expected to start within 24 hours of authorization. This comes after the U.K. authorized the vaccine last week, and after Canada authorized the vaccine Tuesday. The committee is expected to meet once again on Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna's EUA application. Coverage from across the political spectrum tended to speculate about the likelihood of the vaccine receiving approval, as well as providing detailed description of how the vaccine was developed. Editor's Note: A earlier version of this story misspelled BioNTech. We regret the error.
TITLE=> Trump's State of the Union Ratings. ARTICLE=> President Trump drew ire across the aisle for incorrectly claiming that his State of the Union address on Tuesday was the most watched in history, with Clinton, Bush, and Obama all drawing higher ratings at some point during their respective presidencies.
TITLE=> Sinclair Broadcasting Required Local News Anchors to Film "False News" Promo. ARTICLE=> Sinclair Broadcasting required its local news anchors across the country to read from an identical script warning against fake news and criticizing the mainstream media for "irresponsible, one-sided news stories." Many on the Left denounced the network for displaying conservative, pro-Trump bias, while some on the Right argued that such criticism is a double standard.
TITLE=> Fact Check: Is There Over $1 Trillion in Unspent COVID-19 Relief Funds?. ARTICLE=> Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's (CRFB) Covid Money Tracker say that over $1 trillion of federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds have not yet been spent. Republican lawmakers, conservatives and some media outlets have closely tracked unspent funds over the course of the pandemic as the U.S. government has passed multiple trillion-dollar relief packages. 	Limited coverage of the $1 trillion claim has differed significantly along partisan lines. In February, Politifact (Lean Left bias) described the notion as a "top Republican talking point" and as "oversimplifying the status of the funds," and pointed to a Jan. 27 CRFB blog post that said some of the relief money "is already allocated or scheduled to be spent, and a small portion will never be spent." A Fox Business (Lean Right) report published Monday framed the GAO report in the context of current Democratic-led efforts to advance $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation legislation, and mentioned that the government's 2021 deficit to date is roughly $2.2 trillion. Other outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal (Center), reported as early as last August on billions of unspent COVID-19 relief dollars.
TITLE=> New York Times, Washington Post, NBC Correct Their Reports About Giuliani's Contact With FBI. ARTICLE=> On Saturday, the Washington Post, New York Times, and NBC News corrected earlier reports that said former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was directly warned by the FBI that he was the target of a Russian disinformation campaign. This comes after federal investigators searched Giuliani's office and home Thursday in an investigation tied to a criminal probe of the former mayor's business dealings in Ukraine. The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, was the first to report on Thursday that Giuliani was warned that he was the target of a Russian influence campaign last year, and that One America News Network (OANN) was given a similar warning. On Saturday, the Post and the Times  added an editor's note correcting or removing assertions that OANN and Giuliani received the warnings; NBC said that "as a result" the "premise and headline" of its story had been "changed to reflect the corrected information." Giuliani called out the three newsrooms on Twitter, and challenged them to reveal their sources.  Each outlet received criticism from across the political spectrum for the mistake. CNN called the corrections "black eyes to the newsrooms which have aggressively reported on Giuliani's contacts with Ukrainians." Right-rated outlets tended to focus on the  details of the corrections, while some voices from the right said the story pointed to wider issues with outlets from the left rushing to publish anonymous sources with partisan agendas.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Lifts California Restrictions On At-Home Worship Gatherings. ARTICLE=> On Friday night, the Supreme Court struck down California's limits on home-based worship meetings, saying it violated constitutional rights. The court's five conservative justices agreed to lift California restrictions that apply to in-home religious gatherings, while the court's three liberals and Chief Justice John Roberts would not have done so. Currently, most of the state limits indoor social gatherings to no more than three households and require attendees to wear masks and keep a physical distance. The unsigned order from the court states, “California treats some comparable secular activities more favorably than at-home religious exercise,” referencing the state's decision to allow hair salons, retail stores, and movie theaters to reopen. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Sonia Sotomayor that the court's decision hurts state officials' ability to address the public health emergency. The court acknowledged that California's policy on gatherings will change next week, but said the restrictions will remain in place until then and that “officials with a track record of 'moving the goalposts' retain authority to reinstate those heightened restrictions at any time.” This order comes after a series of cases in which the court barred officials from enacting some COVID-related restrictions on religious gatherings. In February, The Supreme Court ordered California to allow churches to resume indoor worship services at limited capacity. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Some left-rated coverage highlighted Justice Amy Coney Barrett's "decisive" role in the court's dynamic, pointing out that since Barrett's confirmation, the court has repeatedly ruled in favor of religious groups who claim state restrictions against worship gatherings violate the constitution.
TITLE=> Trump Declares State of Emergency In Washington, D.C. Ahead of Biden's Inauguration. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration declared a state of emergency in Washington, D.C. on Monday ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. The state of emergency, which will last from Jan. 11-24, gives the Capitol federal assistance from the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This comes after the Capitol building was breached last Wednesday, disrupting the electoral vote count and leaving five people dead. On Monday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, along with the governors of Maryland and Virginia, issued a statement urging Americans not to come to D.C. for the inauguration and attend virtually instead. The story was covered by outlets across the political spectrum. Right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the declaration; some left-rated outlets framed Trump as "defeated."
TITLE=> President Trump Is Sending Secretary Mike Pompeo To Meet With King Salman Of Saudi Arabia. ARTICLE=> President Trump, who recently spoke with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, is now sending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with the King and inquire about missing Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
TITLE=> CDC Shortens School Distancing Guidelines to 3 Feet with Masks. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relaxed its school social distancing guidelines on Friday from 6 feet to 3 feet in classrooms, as long as masks are worn. A distance of 6 feet is still recommended for adult staff and teachers, as well as in common areas, “activities when increased exhalation occurs,” and “areas of high community transmission” generally. The CDC’s decision was influenced by studies in Massachusetts and other states, where some schools shifted to 3 feet without significantly increasing infection rates. Coverage in some right-rated outlets framed the previous 6-foot guideline as questionable, in one case citing an expert who said it “was pulled out of thin air.” Left- and center-rated outlets tended to feature the story more prominently on homepages.
TITLE=> Mueller and House Judiciary Committee Reach 'Tentative Date' for Testimony. ARTICLE=> The House Judiciary Committee said Sunday that the panel has proposed a date of May 15 for special counsel Robert Mueller to testify.

TITLE=> Trump Denies Calls to Rename Military Bases Memorializing Confederates. ARTICLE=> Calls to rename military bases commemorating Confederate leaders were met with a resounding no from President Donald Trump Wednesday. The debate and ensuing decision have seemingly pitted social and racial justice causes against those who advocate for the societal value of historical preservation. Statues of Confederates and other controversial historical figures have been the focus of similar debates, and in some recent cases have been vandalized or knocked down completely. Some left- and center-rated voices questioned the need for memorializing apparent traitors, and others criticized the president from holding purportedly racist viewpoints. Few voices had written in support of Trump's position as of Wednesday night, with some coverage from right-rated outlets acknowledging Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany's suggestion that Joe Biden is worthy of similar scrutiny.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden Commits to Pulling US Troops Out of Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced he would “end the forever war” in Afghanistan by gradually withdrawing America’s 2,500 remaining troops from the country between May 1 and September 11, 2021. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken traveled to Afghanistan on Thursday in an unannounced visit, telling Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that the U.S. had an “ongoing commitment...to the Islamic Republic and the people of Afghanistan.”  Reactions to the announcement were mixed in outlets across the spectrum, with voices on both the left and right offering both support and criticism of the decision.

TITLE=> Warren Releases Details of 'Medicare for All' Plan. ARTICLE=> Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) released details of her 'Medicare for All' plan in a post on her website Friday. The 2020 presidential candidate had faced previously unanswered questions on the plan, including how the middle class would be affected and if the job market would be impacted. Reporting outlets singled out details of the plan that aimed to answer some of those questions. Some right-leaning outlets reported with clear skepticism, focusing on features of the plan that would supposedly have negative impacts.

TITLE=> Amy Coney Barrett Confirmed to the Supreme Court. ARTICLE=> Judge Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court by a 52-48 Senate vote Monday evening. Barrett is the first justice in modern history to be confirmed without bipartisan support, and the third to be appointed by President Donald Trump. Her confirmation gives the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to frame Barrett's confirmation as history-making and a part of Trump's legacy as president; left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight the Senate's partisan dissent over Barrett's confirmation process and highlighted the potential impact her appointment will have on healthcare and reproductive rights issues.
TITLE=> Tax Day Protests. ARTICLE=> On Saturday, April 15, protests took place in cities across the country demanding that President Trump release his tax returns.
TITLE=> Senate Passes Bipartisan $1.2T Infrastructure Bill. ARTICLE=> After months of debate and bipartisan negotiations, the Senate passed the Biden administration's $1.2 trillion infrastructure package on Tuesday. The vote was 69-30, with 19 Republican senators joining all 50 Democrats in support; Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was among those who voted in favor. If passed, the legislation will provide over $500 billion in federal funding for highways, waterworks, and broadband. It will also "establish a pilot program to demonstrate a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee" and put forth "strategies to reduce the climate change impacts of the surface transportation system." The bill now goes to the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it won't be considered unless the Senate also passes a more polarizing $3.5 trillion budget package. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources often framed the passage as a bipartisan victory for Biden, while mentioning that its future in the House is currently uncertain. Reports from right-rated sources often framed progressive Democrats in a negative light for opposing the infrastructure bill unless the larger budget plan is approved.
TITLE=> Follow-Up: Perspectives on N.Y. Hanukkah Stabbing. ARTICLE=> A stabbing that left five people seriously wounded at a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, New York Saturday night has prompted a range of reactions and perspectives from voices throughout the political spectrum; federal prosecutors charged the man accused of the stabbing with hate crimes Monday, saying he'd been motivated by "anti-Semitic sentiments."
TITLE=> Iranian Oil Tanker Reportedly Hit by Missiles.

TITLE=> As Schools Reopen, Child COVID-19 Cases Rise. ARTICLE=> Child COVID-19 cases have been increasing after a notable decline earlier in the summer, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The organization highlighted a five-fold increase over the past month, which saw cases rising from about 38,000 cases in the week ending July 22 to nearly 204,000 in the week ending Aug. 26, when children made up 22.4% of all reported cases. Burbio, a data service monitoring the reopening trends of K-12 school districts, found that over 1,000 schools across 35 states have closed due to a rising number of COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the school year. Despite concerns regarding these numbers and the contagious Delta variant, mask mandates in schools have persistently generated polarizing opinions in school board meetings and state legislatures across the country. According to a Gallup poll, 48% of K-12 parents believe that all students should be required to wear masks at school regardless of their vaccination status. There are currently 10 states restricting school mask mandates; five are being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education for “putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve.” 
TITLE=> House Oversight Committee to Probe Ivanka Trump's Email Use. ARTICLE=> The House Oversight Committee will probe Ivanka Trump's email use amid reports that she conducted official government business on her private email account. Some have criticized President Trump in the wake of the news, as he defended his daughter's actions but has consistently criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Others argue that the situations are vastly different, as Trump used her account to communicate small-scale administrative details, while Clinton sent and received highly classified information.
TITLE=> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Sparks Debate Over 70 Percent Marginal Tax Rate. ARTICLE=> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has proposed a 70% tax on earnings over $10 million, drawing debate across the aisle as well as within the Democratic party over where the government should raise revenue.

TITLE=> CBS News Fires Staffer Who Leaked Robach Video. ARTICLE=> CBS News has fired a former ABC News staffer who is accused of leaking a viral video showing ABC anchor Amy Robach discussing details of her reporting on Jeffery Epstein and ABC's intentions to 'quash' it. ABC reportedly notified CBS of the suspected leaker's identity after an internal investigation; the person has not been publicly identified, but reportedly left ABC for a job at CBS earlier this year. Few major "mainstream" sources, especially on the left and in the center, reported on the firing. The story continues to be covered extensively by right-leaning outlets and voices.
TITLE=> Senate to Vote on Temporary Spending Bill to Prevent Government Shutdown.

TITLE=> Senate Votes 99-1 for Targeted Stimulus Checks. ARTICLE=> The Senate voted 99-1 Thursday in favor of an amendment to the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package. The amendment would ensure targeted stimulus checks, which would exclude higher earners from receiving direct pandemic relief payments. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was the only senator in opposition. It's unclear at this point how exactly the cut-off between eligible recipients and "upper-income" earners will be defined. Coverage on all sides has analyzed the new stimulus proposal, with many reports focusing specifically on who will qualify for stimulus checks. Some reports from left-rated outlets focused on continuing disagreement among Senate Democrats about how to determine who receives checks and who doesn't. Some coverage from right-rated sources didn't acknowledge the rifts among Democrats, and framed the vote as indicative of bipartisan support for fewer overall checks being sent.
TITLE=> Taylor Swift Breaks Apolitical Streak, Voices Support for Democrats. ARTICLE=> Singer Taylor Swift, who has famously abstained from voicing her political opinions, announced that she will vote for Democrats in the November midterms. Supporters celebrated her foray into politics, while detractors derided the pop star for alienating her conservative fans.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden Deputy Press Secretary Resigns After Harassing Reporter. ARTICLE=> Former White House Deputy Press Secretary TJ Ducklo resigned after reportedly threatening a Politico reporter. Vanity Fair reported Friday that Ducklo lashed out at Politico's Tara Palmeri after Palmeri asked about the potential conflict of interest regarding Ducklo's romantic relationship with Axios political reporter Alexi McCammond, who covered the Biden campaign. Vanity Fair said Ducklo told Palmeri "I will destroy you" if she published the story, and purportedly made other misogynistic comments. Axios told Politico that McCammond disclosed her relationship and was taken off the Biden beat, though she continued to cover Vice President Kamala Harris. After the Vanity Fair story broke Friday, the White House suspended Ducklo for one week, which prompted criticism from those who brought up Biden's words to his staff after he was sworn in: “If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot.” On Saturday, Ducklo released a statement saying he resigned from the White House. The White House received criticism from across the political spectrum for its handling of Ducklo. Two Politico reporters told CNN that the White House's solution of restricting their access to on the highest ranking officials in the communications department "feels like [they are] punishing us more than him." Some voices from the right made the claim that sexual harassment accusations are "inconsistently condemned or dismissed based on the political affiliation of the reportedly guilty party", and that if Ducklo was a Republican, Democrats would have demanded a harsher punishment. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly named Palmeri as "Tamara."
TITLE=> Fatal Police Shooting of Daunte Wright Sparks Protests, Looting. ARTICLE=> Protests and looting broke out in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota on Sunday after police fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old black man. Police said they stopped Wright for a traffic violation and, upon finding Wright had an outstanding warrant, attempted to arrest him. Wright then reentered his vehicle and an officer shot him, after which Wright drove several blocks before hitting another vehicle. Police said the officer, who has been placed on administrative leave, meant to shoot Wright with her taser, but accidentally used her gun instead. That night, hundreds of protesters gathered in Brooklyn Center chanting Wright’s name and throwing projectiles. Another group of protesters broke into about 20 businesses, looting some of them. Officers in riot gear used tear gas and flashbangs to disperse the crowd, and 500 National Guard troops were deployed to the area on Monday. Coverage in right-rated outlets generally focused more on the looting and violence, and coverage in left-rated outlets generally focused more on the shooting itself. By Monday afternoon, most headlines had been updated to feature the officer's intent to use her taser.

ARTICLE=> On Monday, Pfizer said its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children ages 5 to 11 and that it will soon seek full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In Pfzier's clinical trials, it says a much lower dose was tested on children ages 5 to 11, and after the second dose, recipients developed antibody levels to fight the coronavirus that were just as strong as teenagers and young adults.  The findings come as children return to school amid the spread of the contagious Delta variant, which had resulted in nearly 500,000 child COVID-19 cases between Aug. 26 and Sept. 9, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children remain highly unlikely to die from COVID-19.
TITLE=> Manchin's Election Bill Compromise Praised by Abrams, Rejected by McConnell. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) released a list of proposed changes to Democrats' For the People Act intended as a bipartisan compromise. Manchin, who opposed the initial version of the bill, proposed an edited version that would ban gerrymandering, require a minimum of 15 consecutive days of early voting, enact a voter ID requirement with alternate ways of identification, and make Election Day a holiday. Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams praised Manchin's version during an appearance on CNN Thursday, saying, "the restrictions on the forms of ID should meet the needs of the people. And what he is proposing makes sense because...we should not narrow the playing field so much that we push voters out of participation simply because of restrictions that make no sense and do not increase security." However, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he opposed Manchin's version, saying it would turn the Federal Election Commission (FEC) "from a judge into a prosecutor" and would "remove redistricting from state legislatures and hand it over to computers." McConnell added that he hoped "all Republicans" would oppose the proposal. The Democrats' bill is set for a vote early next week, where it needs 60 votes to pass the 50-50 Senate.  Manchin's bill, Abrams' praise, and McConnell's rejection received wide coverage from across the political spectrum; outlets from all sides provided speculation as to the bill's likelihood of passing in the Senate next week. 
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Necessity of Another COVID-19 Relief Bill. ARTICLE=> The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus bill may be signed into law as soon as this week, and has elicited many opinions from throughout the spectrum. Many on all sides, but especially on the left, are more concentrated on the bill's immediate benefits for pandemic-weary Americans. Some on the right are more concerned with potential long-term economic effects of the bill and unnecessary fiscal waste. Many left-rated news sources framed the bill as a necessary move to relieve pandemic despair; some individual voices highlighted the Child Tax Credit and stimulus checks as provisions that Americans need. Voices on the right were often critical of the bill, and features including an $86 billion allocation for union pensions and state and local government aid that purportedly goes too far. Some also criticized left-rated media for their coverage of the bill, accusing them of praising Biden and comparing current coverage to reports about former President Donald Trump's stimulus packages.

TITLE=> Trump Nominates Amy Coney Barrett to Supreme Court. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump nominated U.S. Circuit Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat on Saturday. Barrett was appointed to the Chicago-based 7th Circuit Court of Appeals by Trump in 2017. In a speech, Trump praised Barrett for her record for sticking close to the original text of the Constitution. In her acceptance speech, Barrett promised to model her judicial approach after her late mentor Antonin Scalia, and paid homage to Ginsburg. The Senate Judiciary Committee will begin a four-day hearing for her nomination on Oct. 12. Republican leaders such as Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz issued statements praising Trump's choice, while other Democratic lawmakers like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren criticized Barrett for her stances on the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade. Coverage from right-rated sources tended to highlight praise of Barrett's judicial record and religious stances. Some reports from left-rated sources tended criticize Barrett's stances on healthcare, abortion and LGBTQ issues.
TITLE=> Alfie Evans, Terminally Ill British Toddler at Center of Legal Battle, Dies. ARTICLE=> Alfie Evans, the terminally ill British toddler at the center of a fierce legal battle over palliative care, has died after a high court judge ruled that his parents could not seek further treatment in Italy.

TITLE=> People Call for Boycott, Removal of Netflix's 'Cuties'. ARTICLE=> French film "Cuties" sparked much controversy after its release on Netflix in the United States on September 9. The film, directed by Maïmouna Doucouré, is the story of an 11-year-old Senegalese girl in Paris who runs away from her family to join a dance group. On Monday, Doucouré told Variety the controversy "started with the artwork," which originally depicted the young cast wearing revealing dance outfits and posing suggestively; the artwork has since been changed. The movie was met with much backlash from all sides of the political spectrum for allegedly sexualizing children. Doucouré said the movie was intended to combat child exploitation, saying "we have the same fight." This story was covered by outlets on all sides of the political spectrum. Slate published a piece criticizing backlash to the film, calling it "QAnon delusion and right-wing moral panic, with a smattering of leftist outrage on the side." Some right-rated outlets responded to Slate's piece by pointing to the bipartisan backlash and poor reviews the film received from critics. Many on the right argued having children act out suggestive scenes amounted to child exploitation, and that the film fits the legal definition of child pornography.

TITLE=> Apple's Mac Pro Production Will Remain in U.S. After Tariff Exemptions. ARTICLE=> Apple Inc. announced Monday that production of its roughly $6,000 Mac Pro computers will remain at its Austin, Texas plant. The company is forgoing previous plans to move production to China after the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative granted it tariff exemptions for 10 Chinese-made computer parts last week. Most reporting outlets made a prominent note of Apple CEO Tim Cook's expression of thanks toward the Trump administration in their coverage. Many, regardless of political leaning, also recalled Trump's disapproval when the company initially announced the now-voided move of manufacturing to China in June.
TITLE=> How the US is Moving to Re-open the Economy. ARTICLE=> Debate persists over re-opening the U.S. economy, as the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues to keep people out of work and hurt the country's financial sector. White House coronavirus task force leader Dr. Anthony Fauci has speculated, based on current data, that the economy may be able to start re-opening in May. Left-rated media voices generally expressed skepticism and concern over re-opening the economy and possibly lifting stay-at-home orders too early.

TITLE=> Health Experts, Public Officials Weigh In On Reopening Schools. ARTICLE=> Many schools transitioned to online schoolrooms after the coronavirus outbreak in mid-March; now, as back-to-school season approaches, public officials, health experts and educators weigh in on the debate surrounding in-person classrooms. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other health organizations released a statement July 10 advocating for the safe reopening of schools. The statement recognized that while children learn best when physically present in a classroom, "a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate for return to school decisions." Studies report that children who contracted the virus were less likely to transmit the disease to people they contact; are more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms; and generally recover fully in 1-2 weeks. Voices from the right, including Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons, tended to focus on studies showing how quickly children can recover from the virus. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets generally concentrated on the fact that while children were more likely to recover from the virus or be asymptomatic, the purpose of remote schooling is to protect children from catching the virus and spreading it to teachers and family members.
TITLE=> Judge Rejects Trump's Attempt To Keep Tax Returns Secret. ARTICLE=> A federal judge has rejected President Trump's challenge to the release of his tax returns for a New York State criminal probe. The probe centers on the Trump Organization's possible involvement in buying the silence of two women who claimed to have had affairs with the President. Trump's lawyers have said the investigation is politically motivated and that the quest for his tax returns should be stopped. The federal judge in New York has said that he does not support what he sees is an assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process. President Trump is appealing this decision.
TITLE=> Senate GOP Unveils Police Reform Bill. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans have announced their police reform plans in form of the Justice Act, spearheaded by Tim Scott (R-SC), the party's only black senator.

Some Capitol Hill Democrats and left-rated media voices dismissed the GOP bill as not going far enough on police reform to make a difference.
TITLE=> DNC Changes Debate Requirements, Frustrating Some 2020 Democrats. ARTICLE=> The Democratic National Committee is revising the criteria that 2020 candidates must meet to qualify for upcoming primary debates, including one that it will sponsor in Nevada on February 19. In an announcement on Friday, the organization said it would double the polling threshold and eliminate donor requirements, a move that could pave the way for outlier candidates like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- who has been functionally barred from previous debates because he has refused to take donations from other individuals -- to make it on to the stage. Coverage of the news has focused largely on the details of the policy change as well as the ensuing responses from primary candidates, many of whom have criticized the organization for altering the rules so late into the process.
TITLE=> US Administers First COVID-19 Vaccine to Front-Line Workers.

TITLE=> Democratic WV Governor Goes Republican. ARTICLE=> Last week, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced at a Trump rally that he would be switching parties and becoming a Republican. Justice said "The Democrats walked away from me," and "I can’t help you any more being a Democrat." This flip means that Republicans now hold 34 governorships, matching the party’s all-time high in 1922. Many people are speculating as to what this change means for the 2018 midterm elections.
TITLE=> Dems Accept GOP's Short-term Debt Limit Extension Offer. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) accepted an offer Thursday from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to raise the debt limit into December.  	McConnell said his offer gives Democrats time to increase the debt limit through budget reconciliation, which would allow it to pass without any GOP votes. Multiple Democrats reportedly indicated support for the deal Wednesday, though they oppose using reconciliation to raise the debt limit. Some Democrats see McConnell's offer as giving them more time to work out the spending package, which is currently held up by centrist Democrats who oppose the $3.5 trillion price tag. Other Democrats have accused McConnell and Republicans of politicizing the debt ceiling situation instead of acting quickly to avoid a potential economic recession. McConnell has repeatedly told Democrats to raise the debt limit with reconciliation since they already plan to use it to pass the Biden administration's multi-trillion dollar spending package. The news was covered prominently across the political media spectrum, with most reports highlighting how Democrats were unsatisfied with the proposal but ultimately planned to accept and delay the issue. Coverage from right-rated sources sometimes framed the news as McConnell having "called Democrats' bluff." Reports from left-rated outlets sometimes highlighted remarks from Democratic lawmakers who said McConnell caved to Democratic demands to stop delaying action on the debt ceiling. Updated 10/7/21 at 11:05 a.m. to include Schumer's acceptance.
TITLE=> Thursday Stock Market Dip Worst Since Mid-March. ARTICLE=> All three major U.S. market averages took a significant dip on Thursday; the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.9 percent, the S&P 500 dropped 5.9 percent and the Nasdaq Composite slid 5.3 percent.

TITLE=> New Findings Suggest Epstein's Death Was Homicide. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner hired by Jeffrey Epstein's brother, said evidence suggests that Epstein died by strangulation. Baden says several of Epstein's injuries, including the breaking of the hyoid bone in the neck, "are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings." NYC chief medical examiner Barbara Sampson, who ruled Epstein's death a suicide after he was found hanging in his Manhattan jail cell August 10 while awaiting trial, disputed Baden's findings and stood by the initial autopsy. Some conspiracy theorists have suggested Epstein was murdered, even going as far as suggesting the Clintons, Prince Andrew, and President Donald Trump were somehow involved.

TITLE=> Biden Supports Changes to Filibuster. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden is calling for changes to the filibuster to require lawmakers to speak on the floor of the Senate to hold up a bill, also known as the talking filibuster. Reform advocates say the legislative filibuster (which describes any attempt to block or delay Senate action on a bill through debating it at length, offering procedural motions, or otherwise delaying or obstructing it) causes issues for Biden's agenda in the 50-50 Senate. The chamber’s Republican leader warns of “scorched-earth” tactics if Democrats use their new majority to bring an end to the legislative roadblock entirely.
TITLE=> Reports Conflict Regarding Plans to Keep US Troops in Syria.

In recent months, scientists and health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci have warned that surges may arise during the fall and winter. The surges were covered more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets, which tended to concentrate on situations in different states and how governments and healthcare providers were responding. Some reports from right-rated sources focused more on the reportedly declining death rates among hospitalized coronavirus patients.
TITLE=> Booster Shots to Be Made Available to All Americans Starting Sept. 20. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration announced Wednesday that third shots of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines will be made available to all Americans starting Sept. 20. The push for the third shots, commonly known as booster shots, comes alongside recent statements by vaccine makers and health experts that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective after 6-8 months. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for wealthy nations to halt booster shots until at least the end of next month so that less-vaccinated countries have more opportunities to distribute shots. 	The news made headlines across the political spectrum, with few major differences along partisan lines. Coverage from right-rated sources focused more on the WHO's opposition to the move and how that conflict might prompt international criticism of the U.S. vaccine strategy.

Bush and Bill Clinton have each independently said they would be willing to take a coronavirus vaccine publicly. In November, Gallup found that just 58% of Americans would take a coronavirus vaccine. The news comes as the U.S. sets new records with over 3,100 daily deaths and over 100,000 new hospitalizations. (Some news outlets reported a lower figure.) Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to discuss the wider implications of vaccine hesitancy. Some coverage in right-rated outlets said some politicians, including Joe Biden, had “expressed skepticism” about a vaccine distributed by the Trump administration.
TITLE=> Biden Becomes First U.S. President to Recognize Armenian Genocide. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden on Saturday became the first U.S. president to issue a statement formally recognizing the 1915 massacre of Armenians as a genocide. On April 24, 1915, the arrest of Armenian community leaders in Constantinople by Ottoman authorities began the genocide in which approximately 1.5 million Armenians were deported or killed. “The American people honor all those Armenians who perished in the genocide that began 106 years ago today,” Biden said. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan praised Biden, saying that recognition of the genocide “is important not only in terms of respecting the memory of 1.5 million innocent victims, but also in preventing the repetition of such crimes.” Biden reportedly called Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Friday to inform him of the decision to make the statement; Turkey's leaders oppose the designation of the event as genocide. The Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu rejected Biden's statement in a tweet Saturday, saying, "We have nothing to learn from anybody on our own past. Political opportunism is the greatest betrayal to peace and justice." The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Some outlets across the spectrum provided analysis regarding how the statement might complicate U.S. relations with Turkey, a NATO member and U.S. ally.

TITLE=> Twitter Permanently Suspends Project Veritas Account. ARTICLE=> Twitter permanently suspended Project Veritas' account on Thursday, citing violations of Twitter's policies against publishing private information. According to Project Veritas, the ban comes after Project Veritas posted a video of Facebook Vice President of Integrity Guy Rosen speaking to Project Veritas reporter Christian Hartsock outside of his home. Hartstock asked Rosen about comments he made in a recently leaked internal Facebook meeting where Rosen said there is “a system that is able to freeze commenting” when there could be “hate speech.” A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to The Hill that the main Project Veritas account was permanently suspended, while founder James O'Keefe had his account temporarily locked, though Twitter declined to say what specific tweets or information triggered the ban. Several recent tweets on O'Keefe's timeline also appeared to have been deleted. In a post on Project Veritas's public Telegram channel Thursday afternoon, the group said it is appealing this decision, claiming no privacy was violated, that that the reporter on the ground never revealed the location, and that no street signs that would indicate the location were visible in the video. On Jan. 8, Project Veritas leaked a call in which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said his company would be ramping up censorship. The story received wide coverage from right-rated outlets, some of whom tended to frame the story as a move by Big Tech to silence conservative voices. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight Twitter's comments about privacy violation, as well as Project Veritas' history and the criticism they have received for past projects.

TITLE=> NY Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, Cuomo's Successor, Promises Ethical Administration. ARTICLE=> In an interview with CBS News Sunday, New York Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul promised to have a "completely ethical" administration when she takes over for Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo announced his resignation last week after the state attorney general's released an investigation saying he sexually harassed 11 women; he will step down next Tuesday. The New York State Assembly decided on Friday to suspend its impeachment investigation into Cuomo, who many still face criminal charges in connection with the harassment claims. Cuomo's administration was also scrutinized for underreporting COVID-19 related deaths in nursing homes after filling empty long-term care facility beds with positive COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic. Hochul vowed to cooperate with questions about the nursing home deaths, as well as calls from state lawmakers for her to prove she was unaware of Cuomo's alleged sexual misconduct. Hochul's upcoming takeover made headlines across the political spectrum. Hochul, who will be the state's first female governor, is assuring women that the culture will be changed, and she is planning to have conversations with Cuomo's accusers.  She also reportedly plans to run for reelection in 2022.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Filling Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court Seat. ARTICLE=> Some officials are pushing to fill the Supreme Court vacancy after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer on Friday. Ginsburg's vacant seat gives Republicans an opportunity to impact the Supreme Court by filling the key position; one of Ginsburg's reported last wishes was dictated to her granddaughter: "My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed." The Democrats’ call to hold off on filling the seat until January was met by mixed response from Republicans, some who support waiting and others who think they should move forward. At a rally on Saturday night, President Donald Trump said he would nominate a woman for the seat some time next week. Joe Biden condemned a push to fast track Trump's nomination during a Philadelphia address on Sunday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told his colleagues Saturday that “everything Americans value is at stake” and warned of possible payback if Republicans fill Ginsburg’s seat before January. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., requested Republicans honor a precedent he says they set in 2016 by blocking then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland because it was an election year. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum tended to focus on the partisan battle the vacancy has created. Coverage the left tended to frame Trump's nomination and McConnell's vow to hold a vote as a Republican push to fill the seat; left-rated outlets also tended to highlight Ginsburg's last statement, as well as the 2016 precedent. Coverage from the right tended to highlight Trump's decision to nominate a woman to fill the seat, as well as speculation as to who that person might be.

TITLE=> $600 Jobless Benefits Set to Expire. ARTICLE=> The $600 weekly unemployment benefit that aided millions of jobless Americans during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is set to expire Friday. A polarized Congress failed to reach an agreement on the benefits before dispersing for the weekend; how to extend the aid is part of the core debate between lawmakers about creating another federal virus relief package. Coverage from some left-rated outlets framed the expiration as bad for Trump's re-election chances and a sign of GOP inefficiency in Congress. Some coverage from right-rated outlets instead focused on the reports of multiple recent GOP proposals to extend the benefits that were purportedly rejected by Democratic lawmakers.

ARTICLE=> The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2022 will be 5.9%, the Social Security Administration announced Wednesday, marking a sharp increase from the last decade’s 1.65% average yearly adjustment.

The change is the largest since 1982’s 7.4% increase and is slightly higher than 2009’s 5.8% increase. The announcement came as the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 5.4% year-over-year increase in consumer prices, largely driven by food and energy prices.  Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight the role of “surging” inflation in this story, with some outlets calling the benefits increase “massive.” Some left- and center-rated outlets also used words like “spiked” and “soaring” to describe the size of inflation and the benefits increase.
TITLE=> Trump Suggests Schiff May Be Guilty of Treason.

The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that Boise's policy of ticketing homeless citizens sleeping in public spaces violated the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment." The Supreme Court denying to review Boise's appeal means that municipalities in other states will have to abide by the Court of Appeals' decision as well; Boise's ordinance had been in place since 1922. Both left-rated and right-rated outlets tied their reporting to current events in California, the state with the largest homeless population.
TITLE=> UN Votes Against Trump's Jerusalem Decision.

Biden's selections were covered by outlets across the political spectrum. Reports in center-rated outlets tended to analyze Biden's staff picks and their history. Some coverage from left-rated outlets framed the appointments as a reflection of Biden's purported commitment to diversity within his staff; some reports from right-rated outlets focused on the fact that several of Biden's selections previously worked as contributors to left-rated media outlets.

ABC News separately reported that the criminal investigation is focused on Giuliani's relationship with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Soviet-born businessmen who became the first individuals charged in connection with the Ukraine controversy earlier this week.

Outlets on all sides framed the meeting as testy. Coverage often highlighted pointed remarks from both sides, and painted relations between the two country as being at a critical juncture.

Twitter then announced changes to its policy on handling "Hacked Materials", saying it will now "label Tweets to provide context instead of blocking links from being shared." Accusing the companies of censoring information to help Biden win the 2020 election, Senate Republicans are reportedly preparing subpoenas of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also announced its plan to review Section 230 of the Communications Act, citing "bipartisan support in Congress to reform the law; Section 230 protects social media companies from liability for the content posted to their platforms.

TITLE=> Biden Considering First Major Federal Tax Increase Since 1993. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden is considering a federal tax increase to help pay for the long-term economic program designed as a follow-up to the recent pandemic relief bill, Bloomberg reported Monday. The next initiative, unlike the past COVID-19 relief bills, will rely on more than government debt as a funding source. The upcoming measures could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners. Current ideas being discussed involve raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, raising the income tax rate for individuals who earn more than $400,000 per year, increasing the capital-gains tax rate for individuals who earn at least $1 million per year and expanding estate taxes. The last significant tax increases were implemented during Clinton administration in 1993. The report was covered by outlets across the political spectrum.

Coverage of Taliban takeover has been prominently featured on the majority of outlet's homepages over the past week. Some right-rated voices focused on how other world superpowers such as China used "Biden’s slapdash withdrawal" to "add salt to the wounds." Voices from across the spectrum pointed out how China hopes to maintain its relationship with the Taliban and capitalize on Afghanistan’s rare mineral deposits. Most voices, regardless of bias, also seemed to agree with the notion that the Taliban will embolden radicals across the region and continue to raise human rights concerns.
TITLE=> Illinois Becomes Eleventh State to Legalize Recreational Marijuana. ARTICLE=> Freshman Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker (D) signed a bill to legalize the recreational use of cannabis on Tuesday. The signing was largely ceremonial, as Pritzker pushed legalization as a top priority during his 2018 campaign against incumbent Bruce Rauner. Rauner (R) famously legalized medicinal marijuana in Illinois during his only term as governor. The new bill would allow for licensed dispensaries to legally sell marijuana to anyone above the age of 21 and would increase the possession limit to 30 grams. Minor marijuana possession crimes, excluding distribution charges, can now be expunged through executive clemency. Large possession crimes can be vacated through the help of a state's attorney.

Many Right-leaning publications emphasized her reticence towards some White House aides, particularly in the wake of the recent anonymous New York Times op-ed criticizing President Trump. Some also focused on her assertion that many companies won’t work with her due to a bias against the president. “It’s sad to see that organizations and foundations I want to partner with choose not to because of the administration,” said Trump. “I feel they are choosing politics over helping others.” Several Left-leaning publications panned her comments on sexual misconduct, accusing her of being complicit and making it harder for survivors to tell their stories. She was also widely mocked for claiming she is one of the “most bullied” people in the world, with many describing the claim as hypocritical when considering that the president is often criticized for bullying those he disagrees with.

Right-rated media outlets are focusing coverage more on the low U.S. death rate compared to other highly-affected countries like China, Italy and Spain, as well as President Donald Trump's statement at the briefing that the high U.S. number speaks to a recent surge in coronavirus testing.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Woodrow Wilson, Princeton and Racism. ARTICLE=> Princeton University announced this week it would remove the name of Woodrow Wilson, 28th president of the United States, from a residential college and its school of public and international affairs. The decision is in acknowledgment of Wilson's opposition to racial integration and other examples of "racist thinking," according to the school. The news prompted a wide range of reactions from throughout the political spectrum. Few voices defended Wilson's stances. Some called to attention his influence on international politics and supposed discouragement of colonization; others, especially on the right, acknowledged Wilson's racism while pointing to his historical influence and rejecting his apparent cancellation as the product of misdirected cultural outrage. One right-rated columnist shined a light on the supposedly unappreciated Warren G. Harding, 29th U.S. president, who supported civil rights and classic conservatism.
TITLE=> Iran Retaliates With Missile Attacks At Military Bases in Iraq. ARTICLE=> Iran's Islamist government fired a series of ballistic missiles at military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.

TITLE=> Report Contradicts Fauci, Says US Funded Controversial Virus Research in China. ARTICLE=> A report this week from The Intercept (Left bias) details evidence that the U.S. funded controversial virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China. National Institutes of Health (NIH) documents obtained by The Intercept delve into "gain-of-function" research at WIV backed by a U.S. grant. Gain-of-function research involves experimenting with making viruses more pathogenic or contagious to study them more closely; the U.S. grant reportedly specified that the money shouldn't be used for gain-of-function experiments. Scientists quoted by The Intercept raised biosafety concerns about the research, while "unanimously" telling the news outlet that the research "could not have directly sparked the pandemic." The documents contradict Dr. Anthony Fauci's congressional testimony in May, in which he said the U.S. "has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology." Fauci directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the NIH. 	The Intercept's report was covered heavily by right-rated outlets; almost no left- or center-rated outlets covered it. Coverage from right-rated outlets often highlighted specifics about the research and framed Fauci and the Biden administration as liars, while omitting or downplaying the scientists' opinion that the research couldn't have caused the COVID-19 pandemic.
TITLE=> Positive Looks at 2020. ARTICLE=> Everyone agrees that 2020 was a tough year, but there are good things to highlight from the year. Everyone applauds the quick development of COVID-19 vaccines and appreciates individual stories of coping with the challenges of 2020, often looking for life lessons to take forward. The political left and right differ greatly on most of the rest of the list of 2020 good news and accomplishments. The right often highlighted the success of Operation Warp Speed to deliver a vaccine more quickly than many thought possible; the strong economy before COVID hit; the Abraham Accords increasing stability in the Middle East; the increased awareness of the perceived dangers of the Chinese Communist Party; and the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett ostensibly strengthening the protection of Constitutional rights for all. The left often highlighted the defeat of Donald Trump, some of his policies and the record high voter participation. They also celebrated protests around the world against police violence and racial injustice;, a record drop in global carbon emissions even though they were driven by the pandemic; and civil right victories including accomplishments for immigrants, women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community.
TITLE=> New US Jobless Claims Drop to Pandemic Low. ARTICLE=> New U.S. jobless claims fell to a pandemic low last week as applications for state unemployment benefits dropped for the fourth consecutive week. The Labor Department reported that initial unemployment claims fell 29,000 to 348,000 last week, and that there were 10 million job openings. This trend seems to indicate that the economy is recovering as labor market conditions improve; it also suggests that market demand for workers is exceeding the number of Americans seeking work. The fall in claims comes despite a nationwide rise in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.
TITLE=> New Trans Rights Laws in Idaho Highlight Cultural, Media Divide. ARTICLE=> Idaho Governor Brad Little (R) signed two bills on Tuesday limiting transgender rights in Idaho. One prevents trans women from participating in women's school sports, and the other forbids trans people from changing their original gender identity on their birth certificate. Lawsuits challenging the new rules have reportedly been filed against Little and Idaho. Tuesday was International Transgender Day of Visibility (Trans Day of Visibility), an annual celebration of transgender people and transgender rights around the world. Few mainstream or major media outlets have covered the news. Some left-rated outlets framed the laws as unjust limits on human rights; some right-rated outlets framed the laws as protecting women's sports from transgender athletes, and were more likely to describe trans women as biological males.
TITLE=> Alabama Freezes Enrollment in Children's Health Insurance Program. ARTICLE=> Alabama is the first state to freeze enrollment in the federally funded Children's Health Insurance Program after Congress did not renew its funding. Senator-elect Doug Jones is urging lawmakers in Washington to reconsider backing the program that provides assistance to children from low-income families.
TITLE=> Follow-Up: Weiss Quitting NYT Invites Debate About Filter Bubbles, Cancel Culture in Media. ARTICLE=> New York Times columnist Bari Weiss resigned this week, citing a hostile work environment. The move reignited conversations about bias and filter bubbles at the Times; opinion editor James Bennet's departure earlier this year followed a controversy over an op-ed from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton. Weiss' resignation letter rebuked the Times and its purported buckling to pressure from prominent voices on social media; she argued that Times leadership is becoming intolerant of non-liberal standpoints. Right-rated voices joined Weiss in their condemnation of alleged media bias against conservatives, especially at the Times. Left-rated voices generally disagreed with Weiss, arguing that her feeling of being forced out is not the product of cancel culture and is more likely because of her purported anti-LGBTQ and other controversial views. Some center- and right-rated columnists critiqued both sides of the media spectrum for fostering cancel culture and hyperpolarized environments with narrow views.
TITLE=> House Passes Bills to Expand Background Checks for Gun Sales, Schumer Pledges Senate Vote. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives passed two bills on Thursday strengthening background checks and closing loopholes for gun sales and transfers. The bills—the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and the Enhanced Background Checks Act—passed in mostly party-line votes, with the former gaining eight Republican votes including its three Republican co-sponsors. The House passed a similar bill to the Bipartisan Background Checks Act in 2019, but then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not hold a vote on it. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer committed to holding a vote on the bill, but Senate Democrats would still need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. Coverage of the bills themselves was more common in left- and center-rated outlets, with coverage in some right-rated outlets focusing on Schumer’s commitment. Some coverage in center- and right-rated outlets focused on Democrats’ support of the bills.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Dave Chappelle's Controversial Netflix Special. ARTICLE=> Dave Chappelle’s latest Netflix comedy special has been at the epicenter of controversy due to a series of jokes about gender issues and the LGBTQ community. Chappelle quipped that a trans woman's genitalia is "not quite what it is" and declared himself as "team TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist)." "Gender is a fact," Chappelle said during the special. "Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. This is a fact." The comedian has "said repeatedly that he supports trans people." Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos responded to the backlash by saying he and his team "work hard to support" the creative freedom of their talent and that comedy "exists to push boundaries." Some transgender Netflix employees and allies are planning a walkout on Oct. 20 in protest of Chappelle's special. The group criticized the streaming service in an internal organizing message for "continually failing to create content that represents and uplifts Trans content." Most entertainment outlets, which generally tend to lean left, criticized Chappelle's comments as well as how Sarandos responded to the controversy. Outlets across the spectrum prominently featured articles about the news on their home pages, including how Netflix just fired an employee for leaking confidential financial data to Bloomberg. Right-rated voices were more likely to argue that "free speech won and the mob lost," emphasizing how "the whole woke project changes artistic decisions and misshapes art." Left-rated voices were more likely to label Chappelle's latest special as "dangerously transphobic content," with some saying the comedian "blurs the line between victim and bully."

TITLE=> Mattis Lambasts Trump. ARTICLE=> Former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis castigated President Donald Trump, his former boss, during a speech at the 74th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The speech saw Mattis take shots at President Trump after he called Mattis an "overrated general," and for using a doctor's note to get out of the military draft. Mattis is a four-star general who was nicknamed "mad dog" by Trump; Mattis said that he felt "more like an emotional support animal." This was the first time Mattis publicly spoke out against the president.
TITLE=> US Sanctions Russian Officials Over Navalny Poisoning, Jailing. ARTICLE=> U.S. officials announced Tuesday that the Treasury, State and Commerce departments would impose sanctions on seven Russian officials over the poisoning and jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The U.S. also sanctioned 14 entities involved in producing biological and chemical agents for Russia. Furthermore, officials said they would impose more sanctions in the coming weeks over other Russian actions. The same day, the European Union announced sanctions against four Russian officials over Navalny’s jailing; the E.U. previously sanctioned six Russian officials and one entity in October 2020 over Navalny’s poisoning. Coverage followed similar narratives across the spectrum. Coverage in left-rated outlets was slightly more likely to include "Biden administration" in headlines. Some coverage from both sides portrayed the sanctions as relatively lenient and compared them to the Biden administration’s position on Saudi Arabia.
TITLE=> AG Garland Launches Probe Into Minneapolis Police Department. ARTICLE=> Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the Justice Department will investigate the policies and operations of the Minneapolis Police Department, a day after the former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all counts in the death of George Floyd. The outcome of Chauvin's trial “does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis,” Garland said Wednesday. Garland said the investigation will examine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in "unconstitutional" or unlawful policing, which includes "a pattern or practice of using excessive force,” and examine the force’s “current systems of accountability” for officers accused of misconduct. Garland promised to issue a public report and bring a civil lawsuit if any misconduct was found. This comes after the Minneapolis city council approved $6.4 million to the city police department for more police recruits in February, after a June proposal to eliminate the city’s police department fell apart. The story received consistent coverage across the political spectrum; outlets from the left- and center- provided analysis and speculation as to what this could mean for police misconduct in the future.
TITLE=> Alabama Senate Race Nears an Explosive End. ARTICLE=> Alabama voters go to the polls today to decide between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones.

TITLE=> President Trump Withdraws from Iran Deal. ARTICLE=> President Trump officially withdrew from the Iran Deal, an Obama-era international accord that lowered sanctions on the country in exchange for limiting Iran's ability to make nuclear weapons. Supporters of the decision argue that the agreement emboldened nuclear aspirations in the Middle East without consequence, while detractors say that it will isolate the U.S. from European allies, hinder conversations with North Korea, negatively impact the oil market, and empower leaders in Iran.
TITLE=> Biden to Host Bipartisan Group of Lawmakers. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday to discuss their $2 trillion infrastructure package.

The names include Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell of Washington and Alex Padilla of California; Republican Senators Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Roger Wicker of Mississippi; Democratic Representatives Donald M. Payne, Jr. of New Jersey and David Price of North Carolina; and Republican Representatives Garret Graves of Louisiana and Don Young of Alaska.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Tara Reade's Sexual Assault Allegations. ARTICLE=> Following former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's denial this week of sexual assault allegations levied against him by former staffer Tara Reade, opinion and analysis pieces have weighed the credibility of the purported victim's accusations and the media's varying response to them. While many figures on the left have questioned Reade's background and the details of her account, others have expressed sympathy with her struggle to attract attention to her story. Many on the right, meanwhile, have criticized a perceived double standard between the way Biden and other prominent politicians have been treated in similar sexual assault scandals.
TITLE=> How the 2020 Election Will be Affected by Coronavirus. ARTICLE=> As COVID-19 coronavirus news continues to dominate headlines, media coverage is focusing on what the pandemic and its consequences will mean for the 2020 presidential election. Voices have focused especially on how it may impact President Donald Trump's reelection chances, and have also looked at how Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden will supposedly mold campaign strategy around virus policies and responses. Others focused on logistical impacts of the virus on campaign and election events; after Sanders and Biden each canceled campaign events earlier this week, the Democratic National Committee announced that the Biden-Sanders debate scheduled for March 15 will have no live audience and will be held at CNN's Washington D.C. studios instead of in Arizona.
TITLE=> Chief Justice Roberts Rebukes Schumer's 'Threatening Statements'. ARTICLE=> Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for "threatening statements" against Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The rebuke came after Schumer, outside the Supreme Court, said that the Justices "have released the whirlwind" and will "pay the price" for their court decisions. At the same time, the Supreme Court was hearing a case testing an abortion ruling that is four years old.
TITLE=> McConnell Says He'd Back Trump in 2024. ARTICLE=> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday he'd "absolutely" support Donald Trump if he were the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nominee. The comments came in an interview with Fox News. McConnell said "there's a lot to happen between now and '24," and also mentioned that he knows of at least four people who are considering running. McConnell's remarks made headlines throughout the spectrum. Many compared his recent comments to his criticism of Trump's role in the Capitol breach on Jan. 6, while noting that he did not vote to convict the president of inciting insurrection. Some coverage, particularly from left-rated outlets, framed the news as a sign of Trump's continued influence over the GOP.
TITLE=> Poll: Barack and Michelle Obama Named Most Admired Man, Woman. ARTICLE=> According to a new Gallup poll, former President Barack Obama was voted most admired man and former first lady Michelle Obama was named most admired woman, with Mrs. Obama defeating Hillary Clinton after a 17-year run.

TITLE=> Software Entrepreneur John McAfee Found Dead in Spanish Prison. ARTICLE=> Software antivirus entrepreneur John McAfee purportedly committed suicide in his prison cell in Spain on Wednesday, after a Spanish court ruled he would be extradited to the U.S. to face charges of tax evasion, which carried a sentence of up to 30 years. McAfee was arrested at a Spanish airport in October, and spent the following months until now in a Spanish prison. The Associated Press reported that Tennessee prosecutors said McAfee owed the U.S. government over $4 million in taxes from fiscal years 2014-2018, but the National Court judge extradited him to face charges from only 2016-2018. McAfee argued several weeks ago that prosecutors in the U.S. were politically motivated, and that were he to go back and face the charges, he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Spanish authorities said an initial investigation uncovered no signs of foul play, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais. McAfee's attorney, Nishay Sanan, said McAfee will be remembered as a "fighter," and that “he tried to love this country but the US government made his existence impossible. They tried to erase him but they failed." Sanan also said as of Wednesday afternoon, there was no confirmation regarding the cause of McAfee's death.  Outlets across the spectrum covered McAfee's tax evasion charges and death. Some outlets highlighted McAfee's "eccentric" personal history, his use of social media to promote controverisal or false theories, and his history of run-ins with the law. Some on social media suggested foul play surrounding McAfee's suicide, and pointed to McAfee's post from 2019, in which McAfee claimed U.S. officials were "coming for him" and said "If I suicide myself, I didn't. I was whackd." Hours after his death, McAfee's Instagram account apparently posted a picture of the letter "Q". 
TITLE=> Media Outlets Differ in Coverage of Child Shot in Atlanta. ARTICLE=> An eight-year-old girl was shot and killed near the scene of a protest in Atlanta, Georgia over the weekend. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters to disperse following the shooting; protesters were assembling over the police killing of Rayshard Brooks in June. Coverage from right-rated outlets were more likely to frame the violence as having been incited by Black Lives Matter protesters, focusing on Bottoms's dispersal order and the apparent blame she directed at protesters. Some concentrated specifically on the 'black-on-black crime' angle. Left-rated outlets generally reported that it was unclear whether the shooting and the protest were linked.
TITLE=> New Senate Health Bill Struggles. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans’ revised health bill is aimed at shoring up faltering GOP support, but the measure’s future remained precarious as at least two Republicans vowed to oppose it.
TITLE=> Turkish Military Offensive in Syria Begins.

Outlets from the left and right were critical of the decision earlier this week, and have since devoted significant coverage to the situation and potential aftermath.
TITLE=> U.S. Jobless Claims Fall to 881,000. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 881,000.

TITLE=> Amid Pressure To Step Down, Afghan President Pledges To 'Prevent Further Instability'. ARTICLE=> Editor's Note, 8/15/21 at 5:00 p.m. ET: The Taliban entered the Afghan capital of Kabul Sunday, and Afghan President Asraf Ghani fled the country. The following summary was written and published prior to those events. As the Taliban continues to capture territories across Afghanistan, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani pledged in a national address on Saturday to “prevent further instability” during a national address and said he was in “urgent talks” with local leaders and international partners about re-integrating security and defense forces. Amid pressure from insurgents, Ghani gave no indication of stepping down from his position. The Taliban captured the cities of Kandahar and Herat this week — the country’s second and third largest municipalities — and are now looking to take Kabul, the nation's capital. A number of American military officials have estimated that the Taliban could abduct the whole country within the next few months without sufficient support from other countries.  Coverage was mostly consistent across the spectrum. Left-rated and right-rated outlets were more likely to feature sensationalized wording like "Mr. Ghani is stubbornly clinging to office" (New York Times, Lean Left bias) and "his political allies melt away" (New York Post, Lean Right bias).
TITLE=> Justice Department Asks Dozens of Trump-appointed Attorneys to Resign. ARTICLE=> Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson is expected to ask Trump-appointed US attorneys to submit their resignations, with the exception of two prosecutors overseeing politically sensitive inquiries such as the criminal tax investigation into Hunter Biden.

TITLE=> Senators to Limit Trump Firing Power. ARTICLE=> Senator Lindsey Graham is drafting a bill that will prevent President Trump from firing Robert Mueller without the approval of a federal judge.

TITLE=> US Adds 943,000 Jobs in July, Beating Expectations. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy added 943,000 jobs in July, the most in a month since August 2020. Widely-cited predictions from economists estimated that between 845,000 and 870,000 jobs would be added in July. The unemployment rate fell from 5.9% to 5.4%, and the labor force participation rate climbed to 61.7%, which is tied for the highest it's been since the pandemic began in March 2020. Average hourly earnings also rose 0.4% month-over-month and 4% annually, slightly more than expected. 	The report received prominent coverage across the spectrum Friday, with most reports framing the data as a positive sign of the economy's recovery in spite of the COVID-19 Delta variant's spread.
TITLE=> US to Spend $3.2B on Developing Antiviral COVID-19 Pills. ARTICLE=> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced Thursday that the U.S. will spend $3.2 billion on developing antiviral pills to treat COVID-19. The program, titled The Antiviral Program for Pandemics, will enhance current clinical trials of several potential COVID-19 treatments, with the goal of gaining FDA approval for at least one in the next year. Funding will come from President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan. Once approved, the medicine would be available over-the-counter to treat COVID-19 symptoms; the treatments could be especially key for immunocompromised people, who, even if they've received a vaccine, are unlikely to have full protection compared to healthy people. 	The news was similarly covered across the spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated sources pointed out that the Trump administration spent a lot of resources on COVID-19 vaccine development, but not as much on developing treatments. Reports from left-rated outlets were more likely to attribute the investment announcement to "the Biden administration," rather than to "the U.S." or "HHS."
TITLE=> NY Times Says Its Award-Winning Terrorism Podcast Fell Short of Standards. ARTICLE=> A New York Times internal investigation found that its award-winning terrorism podcast "Caliphate" was partially based on unverifiable narratives. The Times published an editor's note Friday explaining the review and flaws, and attached an audio correction to each part of the 12-episode podcast series. The podcast won a 2018 Peabody Award and was a Pulitzer Prize-finalist. Shehroze Chaudhry, a main focus of the podcast, told Times reporters he performed executions as a member of ISIS in Syria. He was arrested by Canadian authorities in September for allegedly perpetrating a terrorist hoax, which is when the Times investigation began. The Times probe suggests Chaudhry fabricated most, if not all, of his claims; the reporter who led the podcast will reportedly be reassigned off the terrorism beat. The story was covered widely throughout the media spectrum. Outlets on all sides investigated the current situation, and also questions about the Times reporter's past work. Some voices on the right framed the news as evidence of purportedly sloppy editorial standards at the Times.
TITLE=> Ida Leaves More Than 1 Million Without Power in Louisiana. ARTICLE=> Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Louisiana Sunday night, killing at least two people and leaving over 1 million people without power across the state. After hitting the Louisiana coast with winds nearing 150 mph, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it passed through Mississippi Tuesday, where two more deaths were attributed to the storm Monday. Flights in and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport were canceled Tuesday for the third straight day. One of Louisiana's energy providers said some people may be without power for several weeks.  	The storm was covered across the spectrum, but highlighted more prominently by left- and center-rated sources. Reports often focused on the aftermath, with many highlighting the power outages and loss of life; many also mentioned that the storm happened on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Some reports from left-rated sources focused on scientists who attributed the storm's formation to climate change; some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on Ida's economic consequences, such as the possibility that gas prices could rise due to refineries shutting down during the storm. Local news outlets highlighted how the $14.5 billion-worth of levees, floodwalls, pumps and gates built in the state after Katrina likely prevented mass flooding and more deaths.
TITLE=> Purdue Pharma Owners Allegedly Moved $1B Out of Company Amid Scrutiny. ARTICLE=> New York's Attorney General's office announced on Friday that the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharmaceuticals, allegedly transferred $1 billion in company assets to personal accounts in an apparent attempt to conceal funds as scrutiny grew over the company's role in the national opioid crisis.
TITLE=> Trump Says He's Unhappy With 'Send Her Back' Chants. ARTICLE=> A day after his campaign rally in North Carolina, President Donald Trump expressed discontent with the rally crowd's 'send her back' chants. The chants referred to Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN), a naturalized citizen from Somalia and vehement critic of the president. Some prominent left-leaning media sources concentrate on reporting that the chant was inspired by the President and that he did nothing to stop it. A large portion of right-leaning media sources give no mention to or refute that Trump is responsible for the chant, and focused more on his expressed displeasure with it.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Brands and Bands Change Names Under Pressure. ARTICLE=> This week, Washington D.C.'s NFL football team removed its "Redskins" name after years of accusations that the name and logo were racist toward Native Americans. Other major brands have recently made similar changes. This was not limited to brands; bands including the groups formerly known as the Dixie Chicks and Lady Antebellum also changed names in an attempt to distance themselves from Confederate history. Anheuser-Busch has also been pushed to change its lesser-known brand name, Brahma Beer, named after the Hindu God of creation. Some left-rated voices praised the changes while crediting the current Black Lives Matter movement for the movement to weed out racially insensitive branding. Some right-rated voices were critical of the name changes, citing historical significance and the product or group's purported lack of intent to be offensive. Some argue that names like Redskins actually pay tribute to Native Americans.
TITLE=> Iran Denies Involvement in Tehran Plane Crash; Video Shows Apparent Missile Impact. ARTICLE=> Iranian aviation officials denied involvement in the Ukrainian Flight 752 crash, saying Friday morning with "certainty" that missiles did not hit the plane and calling on Western leaders to "show their findings to the world." Pentagon officials said Thursday it's "highly likely" the plane was downed by two Iranian surface-to-air missiles; President Donald Trump and other leaders have suggested the plane could have been targeted in error. The Associated Press reportedly verified videos that show a missile striking the plane before it crashed shortly after takeoff outside of Tehran, killing all 176 passengers and crew.

ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump appeared on his first TV town hall of the 2020 election cycle on Thursday, when he fielded questions from Fox News anchors in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Topics of discussion ranged from the administration's response to the coronavirus to entitlement spending on programs like Medicare and Social Security, which the Republican suggested he might cut in order to reign in the national debt.

According to Reuters, the virus kills 5,400 people per day, and 226 people per hour. Furthermore, the rise in deaths has accelerated, doubling from 500,000 in the last three months. Public health experts from multiple countries have warned of new spikes in cases, with WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr. Hans Kluge saying that this should be a “wake-up call” to those with “quarantine fatigue.” There were no major differences in news coverage across bias ratings. Some coverage in outlets on all sides focused on different aspects of the story, such as the firsthand experiences of public health workers. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets often featured graphs and other data visualizations.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Media, Mass Shootings and Race. ARTICLE=> Police reportedly have no evidence that racism motivated the recent mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colo. However, news media on all sides covered the tragedies through a racial lens. Many left- and center-rated outlets framed the Atlanta shootings alongside reports of rising anti-Asian hate crimes after it was revealed that six of the eight victims in Atlanta were Asian women, that the shootings occurred at Asian-owned businesses, and that the alleged shooter is white. Some right-rated media concentrated on race following the Boulder shooting, and the fact that the accused shooter is Middle Eastern and that the 10 people killed were white. Commentary about this media coverage often differed along partisan lines. Some left-rated voices accused mainstream media of unjustly downplaying potential racism the Atlanta shootings, saying outlets failed to adequately serve underrepresented communities with their reporting. Many right-rated voices accused media of rushing to create a racial narrative in the Atlanta shootings; some also criticized left-leaning figures for assuming the Colorado shooter was white. Other voices criticized both left and right-rated media for concentrating too much on racial narratives and not enough on potential solutions to gun violence and crime.
TITLE=> Robert Mueller Testifies That He Did Not Clear Trump Of Obstruction Of Justice. ARTICLE=> Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller is testifying before two House committees today on the FBI investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Many left-leaning media outlets are focusing on Mueller's reiteration that his probe did not exonerate President Donald Trump from obstruction of justice. Some right-leaning media concentrated on the irregularity of a prosecutor testifying about a federal investigation, and speculation that the hearings will not produce new information.
TITLE=> Midterm Election Results: Democrats Take House, Republicans Expand Senate Control. ARTICLE=> Early midterm election results show that Democrats will take control of the House, while Republicans will expand their Senate majority.
TITLE=> House Approves COVID-19 Relief Package, Biden's Signature Expected Friday. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives voted in a mostly party-line vote on Wednesday to approve Senate amendments to President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 relief bill, titled the “American Rescue Plan,” and to send the bill to the White House for Biden’s signature. The House passed an earlier version of the bill on Feb. 27, but Senate Democrats added several amendments which, among other things, removed the controversial $15 minimum wage increase. The Senate parliamentarian had ruled earlier that a minimum wage adjustment was ineligible for a simple majority vote under budget reconciliation. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that Biden plans to sign the bill on Friday. Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to portray the bill as a victory for Biden. Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on the bill's partisan vote, with Fox News' coverage framing it as a "partisan monster."
TITLE=> Trump’s Election Investigation. ARTICLE=> President Trump is trying to dig into claims of voter fraud from the 2016 election but running up against states unwilling to turn over their voter data.
TITLE=> U.S. Issues Warrant to Seize Iran Oil Tanker. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Justice Department issued a warrant to seize an Iranian oil tanker detained in Gibraltar on Friday, a day after a British judge ordered its release. The Grace 1 oil tanker had more than two million barrels of oil aboard that are subject to forfeiture based on a complaint by the U.S. government. There are few differences in coverage throughout the media spectrum at this time.

TITLE=> China Orders U.S. Chengdu Consulate To Close Amid Rising Tensions. ARTICLE=> China ordered the closure of the United States' consulate in Chengdu on Friday in response to a U. S. order to close China's consulate on Houston, Texas. Earlier this week, the U.S. closed the China consulate in Houston over alleged intellectual property theft and hacking. On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department charged four Chinese researchers with visa fraud in an alleged effort to gain scientific and technological knowledge. On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech calling on the U. S. and its allies to "change Communist China, [or] Communist China will change us.” Coverage from right rated outlets focused on the alleged spying and alleged intellectual property theft, and tended to highlight Mike Pompeo's speech. Coverage from left-rated outlets also focused on Mike Pompeo's speech, but framed it as "provocative" and likely to "up the ante."
TITLE=> Attorneys For Whistleblower Worry For Client's Safety. ARTICLE=> Attorneys for the whistleblower say that President Trump's call for the whistleblower to be unmasked has endangered their client. The whistleblower's complaint regarding the President's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has triggered a presidential impeachment inquiry.
TITLE=> Trump Told Journalist He Downplayed Coronavirus Threat. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump told journalist Bob Woodward in February that he intentionally downplayed the coronavirus threat to the Unites States before issuing the government’s initial social distancing guidelines in March. Trump made these comments on-the-record; the interviews will be used in Woodward’s upcoming book on Trump’s presidency, “Rage." CNN obtained an advance copy of “Rage,” as well as some clips of Woodward's recordings, and published some excerpts Wednesday. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump "has never lied to the American public on COVID,” and that he was "expressing calm and his actions reflect that.” Trump said in a press conference that he was referring to his public statements, saying “we don’t want to instill panic." Anthony Fauci told Fox News Wednesday that he "didn't get any sense that [Trump] was distorting anything." Woodward has since received backlash for waiting to publish Trump's comments until more than six months later; Woodward told the Associated Press Wednesday he needed time to verify the accuracy of the comments. Media coverage from left- and center-rated outlets focused on Trump's comments; some voices from the left suggested that lives could have been saved if the president had taken action sooner. Coverage from some right-rated outlets tended to highlight McEnany's comments and Fauci's comments.
TITLE=> CDC Says Fully Vaccinated People Can Travel Safely Within US. ARTICLE=> The CDC updated its domestic travel guidelines on Friday, saying that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can travel safely within the U.S. without testing or self-quarantining. However, travelers are still advised to wear masks, social distance and wash their hands frequently. The change comes as a growing body of evidence suggests that fully vaccinated people are less likely to develop asymptomatic infections and less likely to transmit the coronavirus to others. About 100 million Americans had received at least one vaccine dose as of Friday afternoon. Outlets across the spectrum covered this story; unlike right-rated outlets, left- and center-rated outlets featured it prominently on homepages. Headlines in some left- and center-rated outlets said that vaccinated people “can travel,” without a qualifier like “safely” or “without testing.”
TITLE=> White House Press Conference Ends in Trump-Media Spat. ARTICLE=> A series of testy exchanges between President Donald Trump and reporters in the White House Rose Garden Monday afternoon led to the scheduled press conference ending early, as the president abruptly left the podium after taking issue with what he called "nasty" questions from media members. Reporting on the spat differed vastly from left to right. Coverage from many left- and center-rated outlets focused on the president's exchange with CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, with some saying the president's behavior toward her reaffirmed his "open biases" toward Asian-American reporters. Some right-rated outlets painted the behavior of Jiang and other journalists at the press conference in a critical light, arguing that some of their questions were related more to political agendas and less to legitimate reporting.
TITLE=> U.S. House Committee Advances D.C. Statehood Bill. ARTICLE=> The House Oversight Committee voted Wednesday to advance the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which would make Washington, D.C. the first state, to the full chamber. The committee voted 25 to 19 along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans against the act. It now moves onto the full chamber, where its odds of passage by the Democratic-controlled House are favorable. However, the act still faces Republican opposition in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. The bill passed the House last Congress, but never made it to a vote before the Republican-controlled Senate. Those who support the bill say that the issue is a voting rights issue, and that D.C. residents are entitled to federal representation and local self-governance. Those who oppose the bill say it is a Democratic plan to gain two new seats in the Senate, given the district’s liberal electorate, and that it would lead to the district's outsized electoral influence due to the 23rd Amendment. Outlets from across the political spectrum presented arguments for and against the bill, and analyzed the bill's chances of passing the House and the Senate.
TITLE=> Concerns About New Domestic Terrorism Laws Come from Multiple Angles. ARTICLE=> New domestic terrorism laws are being discussed following the Capitol breach on Jan. 6, but concerns about government overreach are surfacing. The Biden administration announced its strategy for fighting domestic terrorism last week; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called it "a serious and growing national security threat." A bill was also introduced in the House last week aiming to "authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices" within government institutions. Others soon spoke out against expanding federal national security powers. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said new domestic terror laws would jeopardize civil rights and minority groups, and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said more federal security powers would create an oligarchy and endanger personal freedoms. Government attention to the issue isn't all new; in 2019, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) introduced legislation to "create a federal domestic terrorism crime," a move that sparked similar concerns. Some coverage from left-rated sources focused specifically on analyzing how the proposed laws could hurt minority groups. Some reports from right-rated sources concentrated on Gabbard's comments and general concern that the laws could undermine civil liberties. Other coverage tied the issue to separate concerns about media censorship and sovereignty.
TITLE=> Trump and Biden to Hold Competing Town Halls on Thursday Night. ARTICLE=> In lieu of a formal debate, President Donald Trump will participate in an NBC News Town Hall in Miami, and former Vice President Joe Biden will participate in an ABC News Town Hall in Philadelphia at the same time.

TITLE=> Man Yells 'White Power' in Video Retweeted, Then Deleted, by Trump. ARTICLE=> Over the weekend, President Donald Trump retweeted a video of Trump supporters at a Florida protest. In the video, a man is seen and heard yelling "white power." The president has since deleted the retweet, but not without widespread scrutiny. The White House said the president did not hear the phrase initially; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president was standing up for his supporters in Florida and elsewhere who've purportedly been "demonized." Coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated more on Trump's expressed justifications for initially posting the video. Some left-rated voices cited the retweet as another example of Trump's purportedly racist agenda; some right-rated voices reflected on the news by decrying what they argue to be the ills of identity politics.
TITLE=> 9th Circuit Upholds Controversial Abortion Policy. ARTICLE=> The California-based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor Monday of a Trump administration policy that restricts federally-funded family planning centers from referring patients for abortions. Coverage from left-rated outlets generally focused more on perceived consequences of the ruling, especially for low-income women and families; some reporting from right-rated outlets focused more on the history of the legislation, known as Title X, and arguments for preventing "taxpayer-funded" abortions.
TITLE=> Puerto Rico Restructuring Bill. ARTICLE=> House leaders came to an agreement to restructure Puerto Rico's 72 billion dollar debt.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden’s Infrastructure Plan. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden unveiled his new $2.2 trillion infrastructure plan, titled the “American Jobs Plan,” in a Wednesday speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The proposal would provide hundreds of billions of dollars to several projects over the next eight years, funded by corporate tax hikes estimated to cover the bill’s cost in 15 years and provide additional funding afterward. The plan comes off the back of a recently-passed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill and is expected to be followed up with an “American Family Plan” funded by taxes on wealthy individuals. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to criticize the bill’s tax hikes as economically harmful and its spending as unnecessary and overly broad. Voices in left-rated outlets tended to praise the bill’s focus on long-overlooked infrastructure priorities and contrast Biden’s infrastructure push with former President Donald Trump’s legacy.
TITLE=> Trump Denounces Critics of PR Response.

The declaration coincided with another alarming milestone in the country's struggle with the pandemic, as the U.S. on Saturday overtook Italy to have the highest death toll in the world. Coverage of the developments were fairly straightforward, with some outlets noting that the 50-state disaster order is the first in U.S. history.
TITLE=> Biden Receives COVID-19 Vaccine. ARTICLE=> President-elect Joe Biden received the COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine in a televised appearance Monday afternoon. Biden received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech two-shot vaccine at a Delaware hospital, where he was joined by incoming First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, who received a vaccine dose earlier in the day. The Bidens' inoculation comes after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines began distribution last week. Biden, who said he was getting vaccinated to "demonstrate... there's nothing to worry about" regarding the vaccine, also gave President Donald Trump’s administration some credit for "getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed.” Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is reportedly expected to receive vaccination next week as part of preparation for the upcoming administration. The story received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Some right-rated outlets highlighted Biden's remarks crediting Operation Warp Speed, while some coverage from the left highlighted other leaders who were vaccinated, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
TITLE=> Audit Requested into $300 Million Contract. ARTICLE=> Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello has requested a federal audit to investigate why a $300 million contract to restore the island's power was awarded to a very small company with ties to Donald Trump's Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke.

ARTICLE=> The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot has subpoenaed Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official under President Donald Trump who was involved in questioning the results of the 2020 election.

TITLE=> Consumer Prices Rise 5% Since May 2020 Despite Slower Monthly Inflation. ARTICLE=> The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday that consumer prices increased 5% in the 12-month period ending in May, higher than April’s 4.2% yearly increase, despite monthly inflation slowing from 0.8% in April to 0.6% in May. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.8% in the highest yearly increase since June 1992. This outpaced experts’ expectations, which anticipated 3.5% core inflation and 4.7% overall inflation. The new data is partly explained by the "base effect" of unusually low inflation in May 2020. Additionally, a third of May’s price increase came from a 7.3% monthly increase in used car and truck prices, down from a 10% increase the previous month. The April inflation report spurred a 680-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but Wall Street approached record highs on Thursday following the latest report.  Coverage in center- and left-rated outlets was more trusting of many economists’ belief that the high inflation was temporary, sometimes quoting market experts who called the inflation “transitory.” Coverage in some right-rated outlets was skeptical of that narrative. 
TITLE=> Trump Talks Pardons in Russia Probe.

A procedural vote on the bill is scheduled for Saturday. If passed, the legislation would provide federal funding for highways, waterworks, and broadband; it would also "establish a pilot program to demonstrate a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee" and put forth "strategies to reduce the climate change impacts of the surface transportation system." 	The bill has been covered by outlets across the spectrum. Most coverage, especially from right-rated sources, highlighted an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office that estimates the bill would add $256 billion to the national debt; some speculated about how that report may discourage Republican senators from voting for the bill.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Should Vaccinated People Mask Up Again?. ARTICLE=> After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Tuesday that some vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors, commentators across the spectrum revived the sharp left-right divide over mask-wearing. The new CDC guidance says everyone should wear masks indoors in COVID-19 hotspots and in schools for grades K-12. The CDC initially dropped its mask recommendation in mid-May. 	Many right-rated voices criticized the CDC guidance as overbearing and lacking data to support it, and pointed to studies that suggest vaccinated people don't need to wear masks. Some left-rated voices agreed with the CDC guidance, and highlighted concerns and studies that say vaccinated people may still be spreading the virus. Some center-rated outlets aimed to break down the confusion from both sides; many others in the center highlighted a CDC COVID-19 heatmap with headlines encouraging readers to learn about pandemic data in their region.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Donald Trump's QAnon Remarks. ARTICLE=> When asked about the QAnon group in a press conference on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he didn't know much about the movement, "other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate." Trump went on to say that from his understanding, the QAnon group "are people that love our country and they just don't like seeing [violence in Portland, Chicago and New York]." QAnon is a group who follow "Q," a purported high-level government official who spreads information on online forums about "deep state" conspiracies at work in the U.S. government. QAnon's ideas have spread from online message boards to mainstream discourse, as 20 congressional candidates on the upcoming November ballot have given credence to or expressed belief in QAnon's ideas. Trump tweeted support for one of those candidates, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, on Aug, 12; Trump also praised QAnon supporter Laura Loomer for her victory in a Republican primary in Florida's 21st district on Tuesday. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets framed Trump's comments as "praise" of QAnon; many pointed to the FBI's 2019 designation of QAnon as a domestic terrorist threat as proof that QAnon is purportedly "dangerous." The story saw less coverage from the right overall; right-rated outlets who covered the story tended to focus on Trump saying he didn't know much about the group.
TITLE=> Peter Strzok, Agent Who Sent Anti-Trump Text Messages, Fired by FBI.

The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Barrett’s nomination next Thursday, and the full Senate is expected to vote shortly thereafter. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to speculate on the results of the Senate vote. Many voices from the right praised Barrett's judicial prowess, and some condemned the left for criticism of Barrett's family and beliefs.
TITLE=> Merck Asks FDA for Emergency Approval of Antiviral COVID-19 Pill. ARTICLE=> Pharmaceutical drugmaker Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced Monday that it has asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency approval of its COVID-19 pill.

Some left-rated coverage concentrated on doctors who said the president's age and weight put him at higher risk for potential complications due to the virus. Some reports from other sources, particularly right-rated ones, focused on well wishes sent to the president from across the aisle. Other reports examined the potential economic impact of the news.
TITLE=> House Democrats Postpone Stimulus Talks; Negotiations to Continue. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, House Democrats postponed the vote on a $2.2 billion stimulus check. The vote was postponed until Thursday to allow House Speaker Nancy Pelosi more time to negotiate a potential bipartisan deal, according to a report from USA Today. The postponement comes after Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met Wednesday to discuss an economic-relief deal and did not reach an agreement. Democrats’ bill includes an extended weekly $600 through Jan. 2021, a second round of $1,200 household payments, $436 billion in aid to state and local governments and a renewed Paycheck Protection Program. Mnuchin’s counteroffer is similar to a $1.5 trillion package proposed by the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the House earlier this month. Talks halted when President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders in August. Coverage from some right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the Democrats’ proposal. Some center-rated outlets framed the $2.2 trillion as unlikely to pass.
TITLE=> Americans Ponder More Stimulus Checks as Negotiations Stall.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (D-Ky.) have each acknowledged the stalemate recently while prodding the other side to be more flexible. Some reports from left-rated outlets concentrated on those most affected by economic hardships during the pandemic, and those who would purportedly suffer most if more stimulus checks are not distributed. A report from the Lean Right-rated Washington Examiner highlighted recent findings indicating a reduction in poverty during the pandemic, for which government relief measures were credited.

TITLE=> Twitter Suspends 'From the Desk of Donald Trump' Account. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump unveiled his new website “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump" Tuesday; the new website gives Trump a platform to share statements with the public after his ban from Twitter and Facebook. The website created a Twitter account called @DJTDesk, which was suspended by Twitter Wednesday evening. Twitter told the New York Post, “As stated in our ban evasion policy, we’ll take enforcement action on accounts whose apparent intent is to replace or promote content affiliated with a suspended account.” On Wednesday, Facebook’s Oversight Board upheld Trump’s ban on Facebook and Instagram, but added that it was “not appropriate” for Facebook to impose the “indeterminate and standard less penalty of indefinite suspension.” In response, Trump stated Wednesday that “Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before." Coverage from left-and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of Trump's ban earlier in the year and on the Facebook decision. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on Twitter and Facebook's respective history of removing posts and suspending accounts that they claim violate their terms.
TITLE=> Memorial Day 2019. ARTICLE=> Today we remember those who lost their lives while serving in the US Armed Forces, while Americans spend time placing flags at cemeteries and participating in parades.

TITLE=> US to Ban Consumers from Downloading TikTok, WeChat Apps. ARTICLE=> Amid concerns about privacy and national security, the U.S. Commerce Department announced it will ban U.S. customers from downloading Chinese-owned applications TikTok and WeChat beginning this Sunday. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the move will "combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data." WeChat use will be heavily restricted for current users starting Sunday; TikTok will be similarly restricted beginning November 12 unless more privacy safeguards are added, according to Ross. TikTok has adamantly denied giving U.S. user data to the Chinese government; some security experts believe China could obtain the data either way. Coverage from right-rated outlets generally placed more attention on the Chinese ownership of the app, and concerns about China spying on U.S. consumers.

ARTICLE=> On Thursday, Senate Republicans unveiled their infrastructure counteroffer to President Joe Biden, aiming to spend more than $920 billion on fixing the nation’s roads and bridges. The Republican senators said their offer delivers on “core infrastructure investments” that Biden has focused on as areas of potential bipartisan agreement. The White House and Democrats are likely to find the counteroffer as not being ambitious enough. The Republican plan would increase spending by $91 billion on roads and bridges, $48 billion on water resources and $25 billion on airports. It would also include a one-time $65 billion increase in broadband investments.
TITLE=> Trump Tweets About Break-In at Baltimore Representative's House. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted about a recent break-in at the house of Baltimore Rep. Elijah Cummings that took place early last Saturday morning. “Really bad news!” Trump wrote. “The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!” Media outlets on the left interpreted Trump's tweets as mocking the representative, pointing to the president's recent criticisms of Cummings and Baltimore governance. Last week, Trump said Cummings is a “brutal bully” to border patrol and Baltimore is "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess" that is “FAR WORSE and more dangerous” than border facilities. Media outlets on the right pointed out the break-in took place several hours before Trump first criticized Cummings on Twitter last Saturday morning.
TITLE=> 2018 Primary Results. ARTICLE=> Primaries for the 2018 midterm elections took place Tuesday evening in Nebraska, Idaho, Oregon, and the newly redistricted Pennsylvania. Many on the Left celebrated historic wins for women, while some on the Right lauded the success of Pro-Trump Republican candidates. People on both sides also took note of the division among Democrats as the party continues to move further left.
TITLE=> Senate GOP Blocks Vote on $2,000 Stimulus Checks. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked a Senate move to vote on boosting coronavirus stimulus checks on Tuesday. McConnell is now introducing an alternative proposal in which checks would be increased to $2,000, but the proposal would also include probing allegations of election fraud and diminishing liability protections for social media platforms.
TITLE=> Senate Reveals $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Senate is pushing to complete work on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill this week. After months of bipartisan negotiations, the 2,702-page bill has been introduced, and senators can now debate amendments. While the bill is expected to pass the Senate, it faces hurdles in the House, which is scheduled to return on Sept. 20.  A number of House Democrats have said that the bill does not include enough on measures to reduce fossil fuel use and on transit spending. Many Republicans and some moderate Democrats remain concerned that the bill is too expensive and includes unnecessary fiscal allocations.
TITLE=> Biden Says 100-Day COVID-19 Vaccine Goal May Be Extended. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Monday he might raise the 100-day goal of administering 100 million COVID-19 vaccination shots to 150 million. As of Jan. 25, at least 18.5 million people have received one or both doses of the vaccine in the U.S., according to data from the Washington Post. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated more than 40 million vaccines have been distributed, while approximately 22 million have been administered. The CDC also estimated that more than 10 million doses were administered in the first month of the program, but that pace is accelerating in the second month. Biden told reporters that it would take about three weeks to reach the goal of delivering 1 million or more shots per day. Some pointed out that Biden's vaccination goal relies on a daily average of vaccinating 1 million people, a rate that was reached under former President Donald Trump when 1.3 million shots were administered on Jan. 11. Biden's vaccine goal was covered primarily by left- and center-rated outlets, and received little coverage from the right, though it was covered by Newsmax. Right-rated sources tended to highlight how the goal was already reached by Trump.
TITLE=> Fauci Testifies Before House Committee on Trump Admin Virus Response. ARTICLE=> Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Tuesday regarding the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Among other topics, Fauci speculated about the earliest possible time frame in which a vaccine could become available, saying that between late 2020 and early 2021 is possible. He also stressed that the U.S. is still in the first wave of the pandemic, and that ongoing community spread of the virus in some states is concerning. Left- and center-rated sources focused more intensely on the apparent contradiction between what Fauci and President Trump has said in the past, including Trump's recent suggestion that the U.S. should slow down coronavirus testing. Right-rated outlets overall offered less coverage on Fauci's testimony than their left- and center-rated counterparts.
TITLE=> House Intelligence Committee To Review Impeachment Report Monday. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House Intelligence Committee is set to begin its review of a draft report on the investigation into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine on Monday, December 2. The panel is expected to consider and adopt the report the following evening on Tuesday. News outlets on both the left and right characterized the review as a major step in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, as it moves the process one step closer to a potential trial in the Senate.
TITLE=> Vaping Illnesses May Be Linked to Illegal Marijuana Products. ARTICLE=> Police investigators in multiple states, as well as others who have conducted private experiments, may have established a link between recent deadly vaping-related lung illnesses and black market marijuana products through testing and interviews with patients. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention previously announced that 77 of 514 patients with similar illnesses self-reported using some form of marijuana-vaping product containing tetrahydocannabinol or THC, a psychoactive compound in marijuana which provides the "high."
TITLE=> Pelosi to Announce If She Will Create Committee to Probe Jan. 6 Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce this week whether she will create a committee to investigate the deadily violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Some news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, reported that Pelosi said she will create the probe committee, which would not require support from the GOP; Pelosi's deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill clarified in a tweet Tuesday, saying "Speaker Pelosi told Members she plans to announce WHETHER she will create a select committee THIS WEEK," and that her preference is still a "bipartisan commission which Senate Republicans are blocking." This comes after Republicans blocked the creation of a bipartisan committee last month. Two Senate committees released bipartisan reports examining Capitol security and the law enforcement response to the violence, but Democrats say broader investigations are still needed.  Outlets from across the spectrum initially reported that Pelosi was creating a committee, but then issued corrections when Hammill clarified the statement. 
TITLE=> Food, Gas Prices Rise as Consumer Spending Increases. ARTICLE=> The Labor Department said Tuesday that the Consumer Price Inflation increased in June after three straight months of decreasing. The gasoline index rose 12.3 percent in June, while food prices rose 0.6 percent. Because of this, the cost of food and energy will likely increase slightly. While price increases are an encouraging sign of economic recovery, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, warned that "inflation is unlikely to reappear on the radar screens of Federal Reserve officials for years." Underlying trends will likely still require that the Federal Reserve inject money into the economy through large-scale asset purchases and providing loans to firms. The government also provided nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, which led to a record monthly budget deficit in June. Right-rated sources were more likely to see this as evidence to open and keep businesses going during the  coronavirus pandemic. Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to refer to the economy as "ailing" or in bad shape.
TITLE=> Former Top U.S. Diplomat in Ukraine Testifies on Trump, Ukraine Probe. ARTICLE=> Former U.S. Ambassador William Taylor testified before several House of Representatives committees Tuesday, describing President Donald Trump's relations with Ukraine that led to a formal presidential impeachment inquiry. Democratic lawmakers were reportedly "stunned" by Taylor's testimony; the 72-year-old is considered a key witness as impeachment proceedings continue. All reporting outlets focused coverage on the details of the formal statement Taylor made Tuesday, which was 15 pages long.
TITLE=> Police Killing of Ma’Khia Bryant, Who Attacked 2 With Knife, Sparks Outcry, Media Criticism. ARTICLE=> Just twenty minutes before Derek Chauvin’s guilty verdict was announced on Tuesday, a police officer in Columbus, Ohio fatally shot Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old black girl in foster care. Body camera footage released less than six hours after the incident showed Bryant swinging a knife at another girl when the officer shouted “Get down!” three times and shot her four times; Bryant died later at a hospital. According to Bryant’s aunt, Bryant had dropped the knife before the shooting and had called the police for help after a group of “older kids” allegedly threatened her with assault. Police said they responded to a 911 call about an “attempted stabbing,” but could not confirm the identity of the caller as of Wednesday. The shooting sparked protests throughout Columbus on Tuesday and Wednesday. Many prominent figures spoke out about the incident, and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the killing “tragic.” Outlets from across the spectrum covered the shooting and the public response. Coverage in right-rated outlets often criticized the left and left-rated outlets’ response to the shooting, particularly criticizing some tweets, headlines and video editing that downplayed or did not mention Bryant’s knife. While some of these headlines were published before the release of body camera footage and later updated, some were not.
TITLE=> Jeff Sessions to Testify. ARTICLE=> Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify Tuesday before the same Senate committee that heard from former FBI Director James Comey last week, keeping national attention on a Russia investigation that White House officials have been trying to push to the background.
TITLE=> Senators to Hear Opening Arguments in Second Trump Impeachment Trial. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, House Democrats will begin two days of arguments in former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial.

TITLE=> Perspectives: UK and EU Reach Post-Brexit Trade Deal. ARTICLE=> The United Kingdom reached an agreement with the European Union Thursday to continue free trade after the U.K. leaves the EU on Jan. 1 as part of Brexit. The deal should ensure that trade continues between the U.K. and the 27-nation E.U. free of tariffs and commercial quotas. The Christmas Eve agreement was covered widely throughout the media spectrum. Some left-rated voices said the deal happened too late, and cast doubt on its ability to change global trade for the better. Some right-rated voices were more optimistic, and focused on how the deal will impact British voters, as well as trade between the U.S. and Europe.
TITLE=> Trump Supporters at Tampa Rally Heckle CNN's Jim Acosta, Escalating Feud Between White House and Media. ARTICLE=> At a rally for President Trump in Tampa, Florida, video footage shows a hostile crowd heckling CNN's Jim Acosta with the middle finger and chants of "CNN sucks."

TITLE=> Reactions to the Sixth Dem Debate. ARTICLE=> Thursday night's presidential debate, the sixth between 2020 Democratic candidates, prompted vast media coverage and reactions from throughout the political spectrum. Reporting mainly focused on the debate's primary topics — including race and racism, healthcare, climate change and foreign policy — as well as purported winners and losers. Former vice president Joe Biden seemingly did well, while many voices were critical of South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg's performance.
TITLE=> Justin Amash Launches Exploratory Committee for Presidential Run. ARTICLE=> Representative Justin Amash of Michigan has announced that he is launching an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nomination.

TITLE=> Senate Intel Committee Concludes Russia Interfered in 2016 Election.

TITLE=> McConnell Criticized for Suggesting States be Allowed to Seek Bankruptcy. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested Wednesday in a radio interview that financially unstable states be allowed to seek bankruptcy amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic as an alternative to receiving federal bailouts. The comment has drawn bipartisan criticism from throughout the political world, as well as support from some Republican lawmakers. Most reporting, especially from left- and center-rated outlets, focused on critical blow-back to McConnell's suggestion, especially from Democratic governors Andrew Cuomo (NY), Gretchen Whitmer (MI) and J.B. Pritzker (IL), as well as from some GOP congresspeople. Some right-rated reporting singled out support for McConnell's statement from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA).
TITLE=> 2nd Trump Impeachment Trial Starts Tuesday. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will begin Tuesday in the US Senate. It will follow a second round of briefs that are being delivered today by both the Democrat House Managers and Trump's defense team, as many details are reportedly still being ironed out.

TITLE=> Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report Says 1,000 Children Were Sexually Abused by Catholic Priests. ARTICLE=> A Pennsylvania grand jury report says that over 1,000 children were sexually abused by roughly 300 priests, while senior church officials and the Vatican worked to cover up the complaints.
TITLE=> Former U.S. Presidents Raise $31 Million for Hurricane Victims. ARTICLE=> All five former living U.S. presidents teamed up to raise $31 million for hurricane victims, appearing on stage together at a concert on Saturday evening. President Trump also made remarks via video.
TITLE=> Hannity Backtracks on New York Times Report. ARTICLE=> Sean Hannity slammed a New York Times report claiming Trump tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, but had to backtrack on live television after Fox News confirmed the story was true. Many on the Left have criticized the host's reporting on the Trump-Russia probe, while many on the Right feel that coverage of the investigation is a distraction.
TITLE=> McConnell, Kaine Team up in Bipartisan Effort to Raise Tobacco Age to 21. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced a bipartisan effort to raise the minimum age of tobacco purchase to 21. The joint effort included former Vice Presidential candidate and current Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA). Though 14 states and Washington D.C. have already changed their age to purchase tobacco, Kaine and McConnell both advocate that if this is not done for the entire country, a national epidemic will ensue. Some companies that sell vaping products have raised their voices in support of the new legislation, stating that the leading contributor to the 'epidemic' is legal-age peers sharing with others. Juul and other companies believe this bill will reduce youth use of tobacco products.
TITLE=> US Shoots Down Rockets Aimed at Kabul Airport. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the U.S. military reportedly shot down as many as five rockets that were aimed at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. A counter-rocket system called C-RAM was used to bring down the rockets before they reached their target. Officials say more attacks are likely before U.S. troops withdraw on Tuesday. The Pentagon also said it used a drone strike Sunday to eliminate an airport-bound vehicle filled with explosives; the drone strike also led to civilian casualties. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the rockets, though U.S. officials suspect it was the Islamic terror group ISIS-K.  ISIS-K was responsible for the suicide bombing in Kabul that killed more than 170 people, including 13 American service members.

TITLE=> Author of 'Anonymous' Op-Ed Revealed as Former DHS Chief of Staff Miles Taylor. ARTICLE=> Former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff and CNN contributor Miles Taylor revealed himself to be the “senior administration official” who anonymously criticized President Donald Trump in a 2018 New York Times op-ed and a subsequent book. In a statement released to CNN, Taylor called on Republicans to “put country over party, even if that means supporting Trump's Democratic opponent.” Taylor denied being the anonymous author on CNN shortly before he was hired as a CNN contributor. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany sharply criticized Taylor on Wednesday, calling him “a liar and a coward.” President Trump told supporters in Arizona that “in my opinion [Taylor] should be prosecuted.” Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to focus on criticisms of Taylor and accusations that he lied about authoring the anonymous op-ed. Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to focus on Taylor’s announcement itself.
TITLE=> Democratic Senator Criticized for Membership to Allegedly Discriminatory Beach Club. ARTICLE=> Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse received criticism this week for defending his membership to an exclusive Rhode Island Beach club that some claim have discriminatory policies against people of color. In a Friday interview with local news site GoLocal Providence, Whitehouse was asked if club had admitted any minorities since 2017, when GoLocal first posed the question. “I think the people who are running the place are still working on that and I’m sorry it hasn't happened yet," Whitehouse replied. “It's a long tradition in Rhode Island and there are many of them and I think we just need to work our way through the issues." GoLocal also reported that Whitehouse pledged to leave the club in 2006 when he ran for the Senate. A spokesperson for the senator said Monday that the beach club has no "restrictive policy” surrounding race or ethnicity. In 2003 the New York Times described Bailey's Beach Club, also known as Spouting Rock Beach Association, as a place for America's “ruling class," with members such as the Vanderbilt family and the Astor family.  Some on the left accused Whitehouse of hypocrisy for advocating for racial equality in the Senate, yet belonging to a purportedly discriminatory club; many reports from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted the claim that the club doesn't allow minorities. Some right-rated outlets claimed that Whitehouse would be criticized much more harshly if he were a Republican instead of a Democrat.

TITLE=> Biden Unveils Coronavirus Plan, Warns It Will Take Time To See Improvement. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, President Joe Biden revealed his comprehensive plan to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, though he warned that it would take months for the actions to significantly impact the pandemic's course. According to Biden, the plan is "based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial, and it's detailed." The president warned that the death toll will likely reach 500,000 people next month as the administration works to vaccinate Americans and limit the spread of the virus through masks and social distancing. Biden announced 10 new executive orders while his administration released a 200-page plan. The executive orders include a mask mandate on public transportation, requiring international travelers to have a negative COVID-19 test before entering the U.S., an invocation of the Defense Production Act to resupply personal protective equipment, and distribution of tests and vaccines. Biden will also establish a "COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force," a new pandemic testing research board, and will create a COVID-19 Response Office. Biden's new coronavirus plan received coverage across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets compared Biden's response to former President Donald Trump's coronavirus response; some right-rated outlets tended to highlight Biden's grim remarks about the number of cases, as well as the strict orders the administration is placing on the nation.

TITLE=> Facebook to Ban All Groups, Content Related to QAnon. ARTICLE=> Social media company Facebook announced Tuesday that it will ban content and groups that express support for QAnon, which refers to a belief that there is a Satan-worshiping cabal of pedophilic elites running a global child sex-trafficking ring. The ban also extends to another popular social media app, Instagram, which is Facebook-owned. Facebook "will remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content," according to an update of its policy on addressing "movements and organizations tied to violence." QAnon has been designated a domestic terror threat by the FBI since 2019. Most coverage on both sides of the spectrum described the move as a ban, rather than censorship. Some reports from right-rated sources criticized Facebook for banning QAnon while purportedly permitting content centered on violent ISIS propaganda.
TITLE=> Fact-Checking Claims of Voter Fraud in the 2020 Election. ARTICLE=> Claims of voter fraud have been a constant theme around the 2020 presidential election, as President Donald Trump continues to claim the race was manipulated in favor of projected winner Joe Biden. Government cybersecurity officials released a statement Thursday calling the 2020 election "the most secure in American history." Left- and center-rated fact-checks have focused almost exclusively on cases where voter fraud allegations turn out to be false; many of these sources frame claims of voter fraud as being purely conspiratorial and potentially harmful. Right-rated fact-checkers have concentrated more on concrete examples of voter fraud. Many right-rated voices remain adamant that real voter fraud is not being investigated enough by the media or authorities, but some concede that any potential fraud election fraud this year is highly unlikely to reverse the projected outcome.
TITLE=> Senate GOP Works to Unify Around Coronavirus Aid Plan. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans are working to unify around a new COVID-19 coronavirus aid package that party leaders reportedly negotiated with the White House. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials have started discussing the plan with Democrats, some of whom would like to increase the size and scope of the legislation.

TITLE=> Iraqi Militiamen Breach U.S. Embassy In Baghdad. ARTICLE=> Dozens of Iraqi Shiite militiamen and their supporters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday. The protestors were expressing their anger over American airstrikes that killed 24 members of an Iranian-backed militia over the weekend. President Trump has blamed Iran for both the death of an American contractor and the storming of the embassy compound.
TITLE=> Portland Mayor Tear-Gassed Alongside Protesters. ARTICLE=> Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler was tear-gassed on Wednesday night as he met with protesters and stood in front of a fence guarding a federal courthouse. Wheeler, who opposes the deployment of federal officers to the city, was met by jeers and calls to resign when he told a protester that he didn't support abolishing the police department.
TITLE=> US to Share 60 Million AstraZeneca Vaccine Doses With Other Countries. ARTICLE=> On Monday, the White House announced the U.S. will begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines with the world after it passes federal safety reviews. The U.S. is expected to distribute as many as 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, already widely used around the world but not yet authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that, “given AstraZeneca is not authorized for use in the United States, we do not need to use AstraZeneca in our fight against covid over the next few months.” President Joe Biden spoke with Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, Monday, and pledged to provide emergency assistance and resources amid rising cases and hospital overcrowding in the country. On Sunday, the White House said it would send protective gear, rapid diagnostic test kits and ventilators to India. Approximately 53% of the U.S. adult population has received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine; the U.S. expects to have enough vaccine supply for the entire population by early summer. The news received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Left-rated outlets tended to highlight the COVID-19 situation in India; the Biden administration's delayed public statements on India faced some backlash from some voices on the left earlier in the week. Some outlets on the right tended to focus on the logistics of vaccine distribution.
TITLE=> Trump Supports Immunity Deal. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Friday urged his former top adviser, Michael Flynn, to seek an immunity deal from Congress, after news broke late Thursday that Flynn was seeking such a deal.
TITLE=> Sen. Josh Hawley to Object to Electoral College Certification. ARTICLE=> Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said on Wednesday that he could not “vote to certify the Electoral College results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws.” Hawley is the first Republican senator to raise such an objection, joining a group of objecting House Republicans and defying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s opposition to further challenges. Hawley’s backing will guarantee a debate over the objections in both houses of Congress. Hawley’s statement also cited similar objections made by Democrats after the 2004 and 2016 elections. In 2004, a California senator and an Ohio representative made a protest objection that they said was not intended to challenge the election result. In 2016, some Democratic representatives made objections, but their motion failed quickly without backing from the Senate. Coverage in right-rated outlets was less likely to say that Hawley’s objection was unlikely to affect the election outcome. Some coverage in left-rated outlets mentioned President-elect Joe Biden’s opposition to 2016 election challenges.

TITLE=> Georgia Hand Recount Confirms Biden's Lead. ARTICLE=> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Thursday that a hand recount of Nov. 3 presidential election ballots confirmed Joe Biden as the state's winner. The audit was launched after unofficial results in the state showed Biden leading President Donald Trump by roughly 14,000 votes. According to Raffensberger, the  audit "has aligned very close to what we had in election night reporting," and is on track to be certified by Friday. The state fired one of its county election officials, Robert Brady, after the audit turned up 2,600 previously uncounted votes. The recount's results were widely covered by left- and center-rated outlets; the story received less overall coverage from the right, though the county election official's termination was covered by the Washington Examiner.
TITLE=> Tensions Rise Over Syria. ARTICLE=> U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said before his arrival that it is clear the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria “is coming to an end” and issued a stern warning to Russia. 231
TITLE=> Senate to Vote on Net Neutrality Repeal.

TITLE=> WHO Probe Says Theory That Pandemic Leaked from Chinese Lab is Unlikely. ARTICLE=> A team organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic's origins said Tuesday that the virus most likely wasn't leaked from a Chinese laboratory. The WHO thinks it's more likely that the virus jumped to humans from an animal of some kind. Experts arrived in China in January to begin their investigation, which was reportedly limited by COVID-19 protocols and watched closely by Chinese officials. Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, head of the WHO team, said the lab theory is "not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies." President Joe Biden recently rejoined the WHO after former President Donald Trump left it last summer; Trump had accused the WHO of helping China conceal the pandemic at its outset. Some left-rated coverage reported that the WHO team was pleasantly surprised at the levels of access Chinese officials granted them; other reports contrasted the team's findings with Trump's previous claims. Many right-rated reports concentrated on criticisms of the WHO and China's handling of the pandemic; some focused on former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's adamancy that the lab theory is supported by legitimate evidence.
TITLE=> Whistleblower Claims Medical Neglect and High Rate of Hysterectomies at ICE Facility; Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> A new whistleblower complaint claims that officials at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility refused to test detainees for COVID-19, shredded medical documents, and oversaw an unusually high number of hysterectomies. A hysterectomy is a procedure where a woman’s uterus is removed, sterilizing her. The complaint comes primarily from Dawn Wooten, a nurse who formerly worked at the facility. An ICE spokesperson said that while “ICE takes all allegations seriously and defers to the [Inspector General],” “anonymous, unproven allegations...should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.”  As of Tuesday, the whistleblower complaint received relatively more coverage in left-rated outlets than right-rated outlets. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to focus on Democratic politicians' response to the allegations. Coverage in some left- and center-rated outlets focused solely on the alleged medical neglect or the alleged hysterectomies. Some of this coverage also linked the story to historical examples of forced sterilization in the U.S.Editor's Note: Updated 9/15/2020 at 4:30 p.m. ET to include new coverage from right-rated sources.
TITLE=> Roger Stone Found Guilty of Lying to Investigators. ARTICLE=> Roger J. Stone Jr., former aide to President Trump, was found guilty of seven counts Friday — including lying to investigators, concealing evidence and blocking witness testimonies — relating to the congressional probe of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. He faces up to 20 years in prison and will be sentenced on February 6.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Duo of Manchin, Murkowski Push to Reauthorize Voting Rights Act. ARTICLE=> Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called on Congress Monday to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law banned discriminatory voting practices; it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013, which said that part of the law was outdated. In their letter, Manchin and Murkowski said Congress "must come together — just as we have done time and again — to reaffirm our longstanding bipartisan commitment to free, accessible, and secure elections for all.” The news comes as Democrats and Republicans each advance various pieces of voting legislation across the country; many Democrats are pushing to expand voting access, and Republicans are generally focused on tightening election security. Outlets across the spectrum reported on the story. Right-rated outlets often highlighted the news more prominently, and framed it as possibly indicative of insufficient Democratic support for more drastic voting laws. Center- and right-rated outlets generally focused more on the bipartisan nature of Manchin and Murkowski working together. Coverage from left-rated sources sometimes questioned whether enough Republican lawmakers would actually support restoring the Voting Rights Act.
TITLE=> As Summer Winds Down, Vaccine Speculation Heats Up. ARTICLE=> As summer winds down, speculation surrounding a coronavirus vaccine heats up as United States health officials and leaders announce developments in COVID-19 research. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to hold an advisory committee meeting to address the general development of coronavirus vaccines on Oct. 22; Dr. Anthony Fauci predicted Wednesday that a coronavirus vaccine would be developed by the end of 2020. On Aug. 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told states to be ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine by Nov. 1. Globally, researchers in Iceland found that COVID-19 antibodies can exist in the body for up to four months. The U.S. this week also declined to join the World Health Organization (WHO) in efforts to develop a vaccine. Coverage of U.S. coronavirus vaccine developments was fairly consistent across all sides of the political spectrum. The U.S. declining to join the WHO's vaccine efforts was covered primarily by left- and center-rated outlets; coverage from right-rated outlets was scarce. Some right-rated outlets and voices focused on purported "anti-vaccine" efforts from people who allegedly want to undermine Trump's re-election chances.
TITLE=> FBI Runs Record Number of Gun Background Checks in March. ARTICLE=> The FBI conducted approximately 4.7 million background checks for individuals purchasing firearms in last month, which is a 36% increase from the previous month. CNN reported Thursday that more than 2 million of those checks were for new gun purchases; while the amount of background checks doesn't directly indicate to gun sales, groups such as the National Shooting Sports Federation (NSSF) compare FBI background checks with actual sales data to determine sales figures. As for the source of the surge, NSSF spokesman Mark Oliva told CNN he thought the threat of gun control legislation was the catalyst for the guns sale surge, while others suggest some of the sales came from people who their stimulus checks to buy guns. The last time gun sales spiked significantly was March 2020, when the start of the COVID-19 pandemic caused Americans to hoard guns and bullets, in addition to household supplies such as toilet paper. The surge comes after the Democratic-majority House passed legislation last month to tighten gun-purchase background checks, and after Democrats renewed calls for action on guns after the recent mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia last month. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Outlets from the left and center tended to mention recent mass shootings and Democrats' gun reform push in headlines and prominently in articles, while some coverage from the right tended to highlight those who pointed to COVID-19 stimulus checks as the reason for the surge.
TITLE=> US, Others Accuse Russia of Attempted Hacks on Virus Vaccine Development. ARTICLE=> The U.S., Britain and Canada accused Russian hackers Thursday of attempting to pilfer research related to COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine development. A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia "has nothing to do" with the alleged hacks. The accused hacking group, known as 'Cozy Bear', is reportedly linked to Russian intelligence operations; it was also accused of involvement in the breach of Democratic party data before the 2016 election. There were few notable differences in reporting as of Thursday afternoon; many reports referenced a recently increased focus in the U.S. on cybersecurity and combating foreign cyber-interference. Some coverage from right-rated outlets also mentioned potential cases of similar data thefts attempted by hackers with ties to China.
TITLE=> US Adds 850,000 Jobs in June; Unemployment at 5.9%. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs in June, beating economists' predictions and improving on numbers from April and May.

On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell to 364,000 last week, the lowest level since the pandemic began. 	Most sources across the spectrum framed the report as a positive sign for the economy's post-pandemic recovery. Some coverage from left- and center-rated outlets also highlighted that the economy still has almost 7 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic.

TITLE=> Dem Debates: Round Seven. ARTICLE=> The seventh debate between 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will take place Tuesday night at 9 p.m. EST, the last before the first primary vote is cast in Iowa. Six candidates qualified: former Vice President Joe Biden (DE), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I -VT), Sen.

TITLE=> Analysis Of The October Democratic Debate. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday night, CNN and The New York Times hosted a Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio that saw Elizabeth Warren on the firing line after her recent jump to the top of some national polls. Several in the media thought Bernie Sanders bounced back by addressing health concerns after a recent heart attack, and receiving an endorsement from "The Squad." Several in the media also credited Pete Buttigieg's efforts to portray himself as a centrist alternative to Joe Biden, who some felt gave an indifferent debate performance. All the candidates were united in their denouncement of President Trump, specifically his decision to pull U.S. troops back from northern Syria.
TITLE=> Trump Stands by Tweets Aimed at Four Freshmen Congresswomen. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump is standing by controversial tweets directed at the four freshman progressive Congresswomen.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Some Mask Mandates Return as Delta Variant Surges. ARTICLE=> The rise of the highly transmissible Delta variant, which the CDC says now accounts for over 83% of U.S. COVID-19 cases, has spurred a renewed discourse around vaccines and face masks. State and local governments have taken divergent approaches to renewing mask mandates; as Los Angeles County reinstated its indoor mask mandate, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vowed that there would “be no mask mandate imposed” in his state. While about 68% of American adults have received at least one vaccine dose as of Wednesday, many areas are experiencing infection levels not seen since the winter surge. These communities face what some call a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” with 97% of hospitalizations and 99% of deaths occurring among unvaccinated people.  Voices in left-rated outlets tended to favor new mask mandates and call out vaccine hesitancy. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to criticize new mask mandates, with some voices defending “asking questions” about COVID-19 vaccines. 
TITLE=> Biden, Sanders Cancel Rallies, Cite Coronavirus Concerns. ARTICLE=> Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) each cancelled campaign rallies scheduled for Tuesday night in Ohio, citing concerns over public health and the COVID-19 coronavirus.

TITLE=> North Korea Nuclear Program. ARTICLE=> According to North Korean state media, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un claimed that its nuclear arsenal was a "powerful deterrent" to the United States.

ARTICLE=> Led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), more than 200 members of Congress have come out in support of removing President Donald Trump from office, either with the 25th Amendment or through impeachment. Democrats could reportedly draft articles of impeachment as soon as next week; Vice President Mike Pence reportedly doesn't plan to invoke the 25th Amendment, which would make him president if he, a majority of the Cabinet and two-thirds of Congress deem Trump unfit. With Joe Biden's inauguration set for Jan. 20, some experts say Trump's removal is unlikely. GOP lawmakers including Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) have criticized the call for Trump's removal. Outlets on all sides covered the news. Left-rated sources focused more on calls for removal; some right-rated outlets concentrated on opposition to removal. Others, especially right-rated sources, focused specifically on Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), the lone Republican lawmakers to explicitly support removal as of Friday afternoon, and on Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb. ), who said he'll "consider" potential new impeachment articles. Updated 1/8/21 at 5:42 p.m. ET with Murkowski's opinion.

TITLE=> Top Doctors Say Virus is Disappearing in Italy; Other Experts Disagree. ARTICLE=> Several Italian doctors' recent descriptions of how the COVID-19 coronavirus is losing potency and prevalence in Italy were met with push back from World Health Organization (WHO) officials and several U.S.-based health experts. The Italian doctors noted that the virus is seemingly losing strength, and is no longer as widespread or viral in Italy as it once was; other experts warned that there's not yet any scientific evidence to back that notion. Coverage from right-rated media concentrated more on the apparent optimism from the Italian doctors. Left- and center-rated media reported more widely on the news, with coverage from left-rated outlets generally focused more on the words of caution from the WHO and others.

TITLE=> Perspectives: West Coast Wildfires and Climate Change. ARTICLE=> After weeks of heatwaves with record-breaking temperatures, wildfires have popped all along the west coast of the U.S. According to the National Weather Service, the heat exacerbated by a high-pressure system and a weak sea breeze caused a "kiln-like effect." The Sierra Nevada fire over the weekend burned a record 2.2 million acres, likely amplified by dry forests and high temperatures. Some studies suggest that these conditions are a result of climate change. Media Matters reported that only 4% of broadcast news wildfire coverage during the month of August mentioned climate change. Some voices from the left drew a direct connection between the fires and climate change. Coverage from several right-rated outlets framed the story as Democrats taking the fires as an opportunity to push their environmental agenda.
TITLE=> Congress Reaches Agreement on $900 Billion Relief Package. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, leaders of a bipartisan congressional group announced they reached an agreement on a roughly $900 billion COVID-19 coronavirus economic relief bill after eight months of negotiations. The deal comes after Congress passed a two-day stopgap to prevent a government shutdown. The relief bill is expected to aid struggling businesses and unemployed Americans, fund schools, provide help to healthcare providers and renters facing eviction, and sustain other areas of the economy affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill includes $600 stimulus checks for every American, as well as $300 weekly unemployment checks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) complimented the deal on Sunday; Schumer said the aid package was "insufficient," but critical to “give the new president a boost, a head start, as he prepared to right our ailing economy.” Congress is set to vote on the package on Monday. The news was widely covered by media outlets across the political spectrum. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight Schumer's remarks and provide speculation on more stimulus checks.

The stoppage reportedly halts nearly 20% of U.S. meat production, and may cause temporary food service shortages and rises in meat prices. JBS told the White House that the hack likely came from Russia; the White House says it has contacted Russia regarding the hack and launched an FBI investigation. President Joe Biden will likely discuss the hack with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the two meet later this month at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland. Russian hackers are also suspected of the attack on the Colonial Pipeline last month.  	The news made headlines across the political spectrum Tuesday; sources usually mentioned the production shutdowns, potential and possible Russian connection. Some reports from center- and right-rated sources framed price rises and shortages as more likely than coverage from left-rated sources did.

Biden's inauguration has been major news throughout the political spectrum, but often with different framing. Some news sources led their coverage with guides on what to expect Wednesday; others instead highlighted security preparations, sometimes employing sensationalism.

After the official certification, President Donald Trump released a statement saying "there will be an orderly transition" on Jan. 20, while also maintaining unsubstantiated claims of decisive voter fraud. The conclusions followed chaos in Washington D.C. Wednesday, as Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building and forced an abrupt adjournment of the vote count. One woman was reportedly killed by gunfire from Capitol police during the mayhem. Coverage of the confirmation from left-rated sources often emphasized Wednesday's violence in the context of Trump's voter fraud claims and rallying of his supporters.

The new regulations allow transgender people who meet military standards to enlist and serve in their self-identified gender, and they will be able to get medically necessary transition-related care authorized by law, Kirby said. The new policies come after President Joe Biden issued a two-month Pentagon review to develop guidelines for the new policy shortly after he took office in January. Biden’s executive order also prohibited any service member from being forced out of the military on the basis of gender identity and prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. The new regulations will take effect in 30 days. Outlets from across the political spectrum covered the story and detailed the history of the military's transgender policy. Right- and center-rated outlets tended to compare the Biden administration's transgender policies to former President Donald Trump's.

The man, Eric Sparkes, said he is a Cuban Democrat and admitted to berating Thomas for having too many items in the express checkout lane, but denies making any racial comment. Sparkes and some on the right said Thomas manipulated her story as a political stunt, pointing to her comment to reporters in which she appeared to backtrack, "I don't know if he said 'go back,' or those types of words ... I don't know if he said 'go back to your country' or 'go back to where you came from,' but he was making those types of references is what I remember."

TITLE=> Independent Board Says AstraZeneca Vaccine Announcement Relied on Old Information. ARTICLE=> The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said Tuesday that an independent board that reviews data from COVID-19 vaccine candidates is concerned about AstraZeneca's recent announcement of efficacy data from its vaccine trial. AstraZeneca issued a press release Monday saying its vaccine is 79% effective against symptomatic disease and 100% effective against severe disease and hospitalization. The review board reportedly wrote a letter to the company raising concerns about "outdated information" used in that announcement "which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data." Several countries suspended use of AstraZeneca's vaccine last week amid concerns about blood clots, which health experts later dispelled; the Biden administration said last week it will send 2.5 million doses of the drug to Mexico and 1.5 million to Canada. The drug is not yet approved for use in the United States; AstraZeneca said Tuesday it intends to release results of a more recent analysis in the coming days. Coverage from all sides, especially some right-rated outlets, framed AstraZeneca's management of its vaccine trial in a negative light. Reports from left- and center-rated outlets highlighted data and testimonies from health experts suggesting the company's vaccine is ultimately safe despite concerns; right-rated outlets featured this information less prominently. Some voices from the left said the intense scrutiny around the drug represented "vaccine safety at work."
TITLE=> New Census Order Will Exclude People Who Are In The Country Illegally. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump released a memorandum Tuesday seeking to exclude people who are in the U.S. illegally from being counted in the upcoming 2020 census. Since the 1970s, U.S. residents have been counted in the census regardless of their immigration status. The population count determines federal funding and the number of seats allotted to each state in Congress. The memo stated that giving congressional representation to those who enter or stay in the country illegally, "would create perverse incentives and undermine our system of government." Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum speculated about how this change could affect congressional representation in certain states. Some voices from the left said they considered the plan unconstitutional, calling it an effort by Trump to "make the electoral college more red". Editor's note: we initially described the memorandum in error as an executive order.

TITLE=> FDA Commissioner Acknowledges Misrepresenting Convalescent Plasma Data. ARTICLE=> FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn apologized Tuesday after scientists raised concerns over his use of data to support an emergency use authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment. Hahn, who said scientists’ criticism was “entirely justified,” initially mischaracterized a 35% relative mortality reduction in a small subgroup of patients as an “absolute risk reduction” among all patients. The studies used to justify the EUA were also criticized two weeks prior by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, prompting the FDA to delay the EUA. Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to focus on scientists’ criticisms more than coverage in right-rated outlets. Some coverage in left- and center-rated outlets called Hahn’s statement an “apology," and some coverage in right-rated outlets used words like “clarified” and “acknowledged."
TITLE=> Recent Poll Data Suggests Slip for Trump. ARTICLE=> Some recent polling data shows a slip in popularity for President Donald Trump compared to his 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden (D-DE).

Coverage of the data from right-leaning rated outlets was similar to that of their left- and center-rated counterparts.

Biden called on Western allies to work together to ensure that "democracy must prevail." The president also reaffirmed the U.S.' commitment to The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), after former President Donald Trump discussed pulling out of the deal. Biden urged allies to "prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China,” and urged for pushback against Russia. Friday also marks the day that the U.S. rejoins the Paris Climate Agreement. Biden is set to deliver his first State of the Union on Feb. 23. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of Biden's foreign policy and how it differs from Trump's. Some voices from the right criticized Biden's approach, saying that a diplomatic approach to Iran, China and Russia is unlikely to yield results and that globalism may come at a high cost for Americans.
TITLE=> Federal Appeals Court Keeps Texas Abortion Ban Intact; DOJ Asks Supreme Court to Halt Law. ARTICLE=> The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that Texas' new abortion law can remain in place. The three-judge panel voted 2-1 to grant the state's request to suspend a federal judge's ruling that prevented the law from being enforced. The Department of Justice originally sued Texas over the law, and is able to appeal the decision. Known as The Heartbeat Act, the ban outlaws abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected and allows private citizens to sue anyone who aids in the abortion process. The same panel issued a temporary decision last week to revive the law after a federal judge paused the ban. The Biden administration said Friday it will next ask the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the law. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources often framed the law as controversial and overly restrictive, and highlighted the ways Texas women have sought abortions since the ban took effect. Reports from right-rated outlets often described the law as the "heartbeat abortion law" and focused on justices' rulings that left the law in place. Updated 10/15/21 at 1:48 p.m. ET with news of the White House's call on the Supreme Court.
TITLE=> General Motors Closing Several Plants, Cutting 14,000 Jobs.

Trump also implied that Joe Biden’s “radical” green energy plans would destroy the state’s oil and gas industry. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight Biden's lead in Texas polls, as well as the Wednesday event attendees' lack of masks and social distancing. Coverage from right-rated outlets also analyzed Trump's chances in Texas.

TITLE=> New York Times Apologizes For A Tweet About New Sexual Misconduct Allegation Against Brett Kavanaugh. ARTICLE=> The New York Times apologized late Saturday after deleting an “offensive” tweet detailing sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The article linked in the tweet asserted that former Kavanaugh classmate Max Stier "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." Reporting and commentary from all sides of the media criticized the Times for both the tweet and the story itself. Many focused on the fact that Stier had worked as a Clinton defense attorney, which the Times didn't report, and that the article did not mention the alleged victim's refusal to speak with the Times.
TITLE=> US Strikes Cyberattack on Iran's Military Computers. ARTICLE=> The cyber attack disabled computer systems that controlled missile and rocket launchers. President Trump said that the US is putting additional sanctions on Iran and would support a course of action to, "make Iran great again."
TITLE=> Trump to Attend, Speak At March For Life in Presidential First. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump (R-FL) indicated Wednesday that he will attend the March for Life event in Washington D.C. on Friday. A sitting president has never attended the rally since its inception in 1974, a year after the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Media coverage differed vastly from left to right. Many left-rated outlets labeled the rally as "anti-abortion", and some left-leaning voices rebuked the Trump administration for supposedly undermining safe, legal abortion and other reproductive rights for women. Most right-rated outlets instead labeled the march as "pro-life", with some right-leaning voices lauding the President for attending the march and appointing like-minded justices during his presidential tenure.

TITLE=> Former Trump Fundraiser Charged With Acting As A Foreign Agent. ARTICLE=> Private equity investor Thomas Barrack was arrested Tuesday on charges of failing to disclose lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Barrack, a friend of former President Donald Trump, was also one of Trump's top campaign fundraisers and chair of Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment of three individuals, including Barrack, who allegedly attempted to influence Trump's foreign policy. Barrack was also charged with obstruction of justice and making false statements to the FBI during an interview in 2019; The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported that a spokesman said Barrack will plead not guilty to the charges. Matthew Grimes, one of Barrack's employees, and Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, a UAE national, were also charged.  The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Coverage from outlets on all sides tended to detail Barrack's history of interactions with foreign nations, as well as his history with Trump. 
TITLE=> Cuba's Raul Castro is Resigning Communist Party Post. ARTICLE=> On Friday, Raul Castro said he is resigning as head of Cuba’s Communist Party, ending an era of leadership begun by him and his brother Fidel that began with the 1959 revolution. The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement in a speech at the opening of the Eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island. He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.” While this is an end to the Castro reign, few are convinced the leadership shift will lead to sweeping change for the island nation or its relationship with the United States,
TITLE=> 235,000 Jobs Added in August, Well Short of Estimates. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy added 232,000 jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell from 5.4% to 5.2%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. It's the lowest monthly number of jobs added since January. Economists predicted that roughly 750,000 jobs would be added; reports across the spectrum cited the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the spread of the Delta variant as reasons for the slowed growth. The economy has added roughly 17 million jobs since April 2020; overall employment is down 3.5% since the beginning of the pandemic. 	Outlets across the spectrum highlighted the news Friday. There were few notable differences in coverage from left- and right-rated outlets.

TITLE=> Biden To Raise Cap On Refugee Admissions after Democratic Pressure. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden said Saturday his administration will increase the refugee cap after the Biden administration announced Friday it would keep the historically low 15,000 cap set by former President Donald Trump through the end of the fiscal year, which ends in September. The Friday announcement was met with pushback from refugee advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers. “We are going to increase the number. Problem was the refugee part was working on the crisis that ended up at the border with young people. We couldn’t do two things at once, so now we are going to raise the number," Biden told reporters Saturday. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday the Biden administration planned to “set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15," though Psaki didn't say how much the cap would increase. Psaki also said that, “given the decimated refugee admissions program we inherited,” it’s now “unlikely” Biden will be able to boost that number to 62,500, as he had proposed in his plan to Congress in February. Psaki said Friday the order also reversed the Trump policy that banned refugees from many regions such as Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and opens up more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Central America. Critics from across the political spectrum criticized Biden for allegedly giving in to political pressure from Democrats. Coverage from the right tended to highlight the fact that Biden used the term "crisis" to describe the border for the first time on Saturday; some right-rated outlets also said that Psaki attempted to "shift the blame" for the delayed cap increase to the Trump administration. Coverage from the left and center tended to focus on details of the situation at the border.
TITLE=> Gallup Names Donald Trump and Michelle Obama as 2020's Most Admired Man and Woman. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and former first lady Michelle Obama were America’s most admired man and woman in 2020, Gallup found in its annual survey. This breaks former President Barack Obama’s 12-year streak as most admired man and continues Michelle Obama’s 3-year run as most admired woman. Gallup found that 18% of respondents most admired Trump, 15% most admired Barack Obama, and 10% most admired Michelle Obama. Gallup also found that responses for Trump and Obama were politically polarized, with Democrats also admiring President-elect Joe Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci more than Republicans. Outlets from across the spectrum featured coverage of Trump and Barack Obama more prominently than coverage of Michelle Obama. Coverage was more common in right- and center-rated outlets than in left-rated outlets. Coverage from right-rated media was more likely to focus on Trump “dethroning” Obama than coverage from left-rated sources.
TITLE=> Koch Brothers Fund Advertisements Praising Democrats on Immigration. ARTICLE=> David and Charles Koch, the libertarian billionaire brothers who are known for their substantial donations to conservative causes, are funding political ads through their LIBRE Initiative that thank several Democrats for their work to find a permanent solution to DACA.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Left, Right Trade Blame for Kenosha Violence. ARTICLE=> Kenosha, Wisconsin became the newest site of Black Lives Matter and anti-police brutality protests after Jacob Blake was shot by police on Aug. 23. In the days following Blake's shooting, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested as a suspect in a shooting that killed two and wounded one. After a summer of protests and rhetoric surrounding police brutality and racial injustice, media coverage of the Kenosha shootings and ensuing violence have become highly polarized from left to right. While both sides are fixated on ongoing violence, coverage from the right tends to criticize Democratic leaders for allegedly enabling chaos in their cities, while coverage from the left often frames the Kenosha coverage around Trump's purportedly failing "law and order" rhetoric. Some outlets from the center connected recent events in Kenosha with overall racial and social inequity.
TITLE=> New York Passes Law Expanding Abortion Rights. ARTICLE=> New York passed a law Tuesday expanding abortion rights, including a provision allowing abortions up to a baby's due date if a mother's health is at risk.
TITLE=> White House Announces $13 Billion in Aid to Puerto Rico. ARTICLE=> On Friday, the Trump administration announced that it would send an additional $13 billion to aid Puerto Rico’s recovery from 2017’s Hurricane Maria. $9.6 billion of the aid will come from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to fund the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority, and another $2 billion will go to Puerto Rico’s Department of Education. Coverage in outlets on all sides covered the announcement and its potential effect on President Donald Trump’s support among Latino voters. Coverage in some center- and left-rated outlets placed greater weight on election consequences and criticisms of the Trump administration’s response. Coverage in some center- and right-rated outlets mentioned Trump’s disaster declaration for Puerto Rico following Hurricane Isaias this summer.
TITLE=> Earth Day 2020 Draws Different Takes on Environment. ARTICLE=> Wednesday marks the 50th Earth Day, an annual demonstration of support for environmental protection. Some right-rated reporting outlets focused on how some areas of climate change research, both 50 years ago and now, have been purportedly misguided; some left-rated outlets focused on the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the environment.
TITLE=> Democrats Demands Mueller Report be Released to the Public.

TITLE=> Trump Admin Diverts $3.8B from Military Funds to Border Wall Construction. ARTICLE=> News reports on the Trump administration's decision to divert $3.8 billion from the Pentagon to border wall construction, regardless of political leanings, focused largely on apparent bipartisan congressional disapproval of the move. Many focused on criticism from Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. The decision to divert the funds, which would have been used for military vehicles and weapons programs, came as President Donald Trump extended the national emergency designation at the southern border for an additional year.
TITLE=> Biden Announces All Adults Will Be Eligible for COVID-19 Vaccine by May 1. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden called on states to make all adults in America eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine by May 1 in his first prime-time address from the East Room of the White House. Biden also announced that the U.S. would have enough vaccine doses for all adults in America by the end of May. Biden tied pandemic recovery to the Fourth of July, saying, “If we do this together, by July the Fourth, there’s a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day.” Coverage from some left-rated outlets portrayed Biden’s speech and announcement more positively. As of Thursday evening, coverage was more common in left- and center-rated outlets than right-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Biden Denies Sexual Assault Allegation. ARTICLE=> 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden denied an allegation that he sexually assaulted former Senate staff member Tara Reade in 1993, as part of an interview on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Friday morning. Biden released a written statement before the televised appearance, saying the alleged incident "never happened"; he stated that any record of the claim would be at the National Archives, and requested that the Secretary of the Senate ask the archives to release the record, if it exists. Most reports on Biden's statements rehashed the details of Reade's allegation. Many left- and center-rated outlets compared the claims of sexual impropriety against Biden to those against President Donald Trump, while many right-rated outlets focused on the fact that Biden hadn't been questioned directly about Reade prior to Friday; Reade's sexual assault claim surfaced on March 25. Some on the right also focused on reports that Biden has close ties to members of the University of Delaware's Board of Trustees, which has authority over his Senate archive.
TITLE=> Trump Under Pressure to Lift Jones Act.

TITLE=> Biden 'Doing Fine' After Viral Stumble; Coverage Differs. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden is reportedly fine after stumbling Friday while jogging up a set of stairs to board Air Force One. White House communications director Kate Bedingfield tweeted that Biden "is just fine" and that the stumble was "nothing more than a misstep on the stairs." The stumble made headlines throughout the spectrum, but was highlighted much more prominently by right-rated outlets. Left- and center-rated outlets concentrated more on the White House's confirmation that Biden was doing okay after the fall. Some right-rated voices recalled when Biden questioned former President Donald Trump's health after Trump appeared to walk gingerly down a ramp in June 2020. Others criticized left-rated media for purported hypocrisy in examining Trump's health after that incident but not Biden's after his stumble Friday.
TITLE=> 117 Dead Amid Ongoing Violence in South Africa. ARTICLE=> Riots, looting and violence broke out in South Africa over the past week after former South African President Jacob Zuma was imprisoned on July 7 for refusing to testify in a corruption inquiry. An official said Thursday that the chaos had resulted in over 2,200 arrests and 117 deaths. The same day, the South African government deployed 25,000 troops to quell the riots. On Friday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the violence had been “planned and coordinated” and that “we will not allow anarchy and mayhem to just unfold in our country.” Zuma, who will begin serving a 15-month prison sentence, has been a figure in South African politics since 1959, when he joined the African National Congress party that fought apartheid and has governed the country since 1994. While many call him a freedom fighter, Zuma has also faced corruption charges throughout his political career.  News coverage was mostly balanced across the American political spectrum. Some opinion coverage in right-rated outlets compared South African violence to American racial tensions. 
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden Says Facebook Isn't 'Killing People', Urges Platform to Combat False Information. ARTICLE=> On Monday, President Joe Biden said that certain Facebook users were responsible for the spread of false COVID-19 information and called on the social media platform to combat false information after saying Friday that Facebook was "killing people." Biden said Monday he meant to criticize a group of people posting false information on the website, and that “Facebook isn’t killing people, these 12 people are out there giving misinformation,” Biden said. This comes after White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki said the Biden administration is working with Facebook to flag posts that "spread disinformation" about COVID-19 vaccines, citing a report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate which said 12 people were responsible for almost 65% of false vaccine information on social media. Facebook's Vice President of Integrity Guy Rosen urged the Biden administration in a blog post Saturday to move "past the finger pointing" and pointed to data that suggested vaccine acceptance among Facebook users has increased.  Biden's comments were covered by outlets across the spectrum on Friday. Some who agree with Biden argue that social media's power to influence people should not be underestimated, and call for greater transparency and a crackdown on false information. Others say that regulation sometimes also inadvertently suppresses plausible information and is not the answer to the spread of false information online. 
TITLE=> Illinois City Approves Plan to Pay Reparations to Certain Black Residents. ARTICLE=> Evanston, Illinois has approved a plan to compensate black residents for discrimination they may have faced. The program, called the Local Reparations Restorative Housing Program, is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States. Evanston approved the $10 million plan by an 8-1 vote Monday. The program's first phase will make $400,000 available in the form of $25,000 homeownership and improvement grants for black residents who can prove they descended from someone who lived in Evanston between 1919 and 1969. The lone city representative to vote against the plan advocated for reparations as cash payments instead, and said the plan doesn’t give residents enough say in how the money will be distributed. Some reports on all sides, especially from right-rated sources, highlighted the fact that the program will be partially funded by marijuana sales tax revenue. Reports from many left- and center-rated sources focused more on the plan's details, and on quotes from people who voiced support for the program. Most coverage from right-rated sources featured quotes from people who were opposed to or critical of the plan more prominently than reports from left- and center-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Trump Administration to Declassify Unconfirmed Intel About Chinese Attacks on U.S. Soldiers. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump is declassifying information that indicates China offered to pay non-state actors in Afghanistan to attack American soldiers, two senior administration officials reportedly told Axios Wednesday. The information, which has yet to be corroborated, was briefed to Trump on Dec. 17. Trump has previously sought to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and increase pressure campaigns on China before he leaves office next month. Some coverage from left-rated outlets raised questions about the motivations of the information's source, as well as the Trump administration's to declassify it. Coverage from right- and center-rated outlets tended to provide analysis about what the intelligence would mean for China-U.S. relations and the Biden administration if it were confirmed.
TITLE=> More Boys Freed From Thailand Cave. ARTICLE=> Rescuers working at a cave site in northern Thailand have suspended operations for the day after bringing four more boys out of the flooded cave system, bringing the total number of rescued boys to eight.
TITLE=> Fact-Checking the Georgia 'Suitcase' Voter Fraud Claims. ARTICLE=> Security footage of 2020 presidential election vote-counting at Georgia's State Farm Arena came into the spotlight this week. President Donald Trump, along with some of his allies and supporters, claim the video proves that vote counters hid ballots from Republican poll watchers; the video was played during the Trump legal team's testimony at a hearing Thursday in Georgia. Fact-checkers including Politifact (Lean Left bias) and Snopes (Center) reported Trump's claims to be false, saying the video shows no evidence of fraud. Georgia certified its election results for Joe Biden Monday. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to report that the allegations and video were debunked by independent fact-checkers and other sources. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused on The Federalist's analysis, which says the video hasn't been debunked and focuses on the allegation that poll watchers were told to go home early, after which the fraud purportedly took place. Other coverage from left-rated sources concentrated on how the Trump administration has circulated these specific fraud allegations, framing Trump and his team as disillusioned.
TITLE=> Trump Pardons Oregon Ranchers Whose Case Sparked Wildlife Refuge Standoff. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Tuesday pardoned two Oregon ranchers who were serving prison sentences for setting fire to federal land, citing an "overzealous appeal" by the Obama administration which resulted in harsher sentences than were initially imposed. The case inflamed local supporters of the ranchers in 2016, leading to the 41-day armed standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
TITLE=> Judge Rules Asylum Claims Must Be Accepted. ARTICLE=> Judge Jon S. Tigar of the United States District Court in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order stating that asylum seekers can make claims at any point along the U.S. border, not just at certain points, which the White House had previously announced.
TITLE=> Harvey Weinstein Convicted on 2 of 5 Counts. ARTICLE=> Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of third-degree rape and first-degree commission of a criminal sexual act by a Manhattan jury Monday. He was acquitted of two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape. Many throughout the media spectrum framed the news as a win for the #MeToo movement, but some, especially on the right, framed the verdict as too lenient and said the acquittal on three counts was a loss for the government.
TITLE=> US Air Strikes Hit Iran-backed Militias in Syria and Iraq. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, the U.S. carried out air strikes in Syria and Iraq on facilities that have reportedly been used by Iran-backed militias to engage in aerial vehicle attacks on U.S. personnel. The air strikes have been condemned by the Iraqi government as a "blatant and unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty."  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the strikes "targeted and proportional" to a significant and particular threat.

TITLE=> McConnell Says he was Wrong on Obama Pandemic Plan. ARTICLE=> Earlier this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) claimed the Obama administration did not leave a pandemic plan behind for the Trump administration. McConnell retracted that statement Thursday, saying he was wrong; "They did leave behind a plan. So, I clearly made a mistake in that regard.” Earlier reporting indicated that the Obama White House ran disease outbreak simulations with the Trump White House during the transition period. However, many of those trained reportedly left the Trump administration before the pandemic had started. The retraction was covered more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets, some of which also fact-checked McConnell's initial statement. Few right-rated outlets reporting on McConnell's apology as of midday Friday.
TITLE=> Blue States and Counties Sue Trump Administration Over Religious Protections of Health Care Providers. ARTICLE=> Over 20 Blue States and counties have sued the Trump Administration over expanded protections of religious beliefs for healthcare workers and providers. This rule is scheduled to take effect on July 22nd, and has gotten backlash from Democrats and Democrat-leaning groups. The plaintiffs believe that the expansion of the rule could allow for a healthcare worker to not administer effective healthcare based on their religious beliefs. For instance, according to a New York lawsuit, a healthcare worker could deny a patient a measles vaccine during a measles outbreak, based on a sincerely held belief outside of medical science. Other procedures such as assisted suicide and abortions could also be denied to a patient based on religious or moral convictions, which are reasonably and strictly held.
TITLE=> Opinions on Jeffrey Epstein Case Show Left/Right Divide. ARTICLE=>  Billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein was indicted Monday after authorities allegedly uncovered evidence of underage sexual abuse and exploitation in his Manhattan home. The extent of Epstein's connections to former President Bill Clinton, current President Donald Trump and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta have provided multiple angles for news coverage. Right-leaning outlets are focusing in on discrepancies between Clinton's accounts of his interactions with Epstein and official international flight records; left-leaning voices are focusing on a secret plea deal given to Epstein by Acosta when he was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and how that places pressure on both Trump and Acosta; outlets in the center are mostly covering all of Epstein's prominent relationships, and speculating about which other well-known people may have been involved in the alleged abuse.
TITLE=> Joe Biden Swings Back At Challengers. ARTICLE=> On the second night of the Democratic Presidential Debates, Joe Biden made some aggressive moves against his other rivals in an effort to maintain his front-runner status.

TITLE=> Johnson & Johnson Announces 1-Shot Vaccine is 66% Effective Against Moderate to Severe COVID-19. ARTICLE=> Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that its coronavirus vaccine, the only single-dose vaccine to pass phase 3 clinical trials, was on average 66% effective against moderate to severe illness, 85% effective against severe infections and 100% effective against hospitalizations and death. Effectiveness varied regionally, however; effectiveness against moderate illness was 72% in the U.S., 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, where a new and highly contagious strain of the virus is spreading. If approved by the FDA, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine will be the fifth clinically-approved vaccine in circulation following Novavax’s recently-announced vaccine. Coverage on all sides compared the new vaccine to currently available ones and focused on the potential threat of new vaccine-resistant virus strains. Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to include that the vaccine was developed by Johnson & Johnson’s Belgium-based subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals.
TITLE=> Trump Intensifies Feud with CNN. ARTICLE=> President Trump released an edited video beating up the CNN logo.
TITLE=> Thousands of Migrants Gather Under Texas Bridge. ARTICLE=> Roughly 10,000 unauthorized migrants have gathered under a bridge along the Mexico-U.S. border in Del Rio, Texas and are waiting to be taken into U.S. custody. Del Rio mayor Bruno Lozano tweeted Thursday saying 2,000 more migrants had shown up that day and asking if President Joe Biden had been briefed on the situation. A statement from Border Patrol said water, towels and portable toilets had been provided to the migrants as they await processing. Sources across the spectrum say the people are mostly Haitian, and are joined by some Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. Republican lawmakers and conservatives have criticized Biden for purportedly enabling the situation. Nearly 200,000 migrants were arrested at the southern border in August as migrant apprehensions remain near a 20-year high. The situation has been covered prominently by right-rated outlets and has been less of a focus for left- and center-rated outlets. Some coverage from left-rated sources said the migrants were "being held" under the bridge; most other reports described the migrants as having "converged" under the bridge and "waiting" to be taken into custody. Coverage across the spectrum, especially from right-rated outlets, framed the situation as another immigration crisis for Biden. Right-rated sources also often highlighted a temporary Federal Aviation Administration ban on drones near the bridge, which has since been lifted; Fox News (Right bias) had previously been documenting the situation with drone footage. Updated 9/17/21 at 5:51 p.m. ET
TITLE=> Second Debate Moderator Claims Twitter Account Hacked After Tweet About Scaramucci. ARTICLE=> C-SPAN said the Twitter account of journalist Steve Scully, the planned moderator for the second presidential debate, was hacked Thursday. The hacking allegedly accounted for a tweet sent from Scully's account asking former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci for advice on how to respond to the President Donald Trump, who recently said he believed Scully is a "never-Trumper" who "worked for Biden at one point," referring to Scully's internship for Biden when he was a Delaware senator. On Friday, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced the planned second debate would be cancelled; some on the right have accused the commission of conspiring to shield Biden. Coverage from right- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the hacking claims, as well as future debates; some reports from right-rated sources also concentrated on the CPD's purported corruption and other incidents of Scully's allegedly being hacked. Some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on those who defended Scully over the alleged hacking.
TITLE=> Trump Narrows Candidates for Kennedy Replacement. ARTICLE=> President Trump announced today the top 3 candidates for filling Justice Kennedy's seat on the Supreme Court.

TITLE=> CIA Director Meets with Taliban's Top Political Leader. ARTICLE=> On Monday, CIA Director William Burns met in person with Taliban founding member and political leader Abdul Ghani Baradar. The secretive meeting is the first between the Taliban and the Biden administration, and makes Burns the highest-ranking U.S. official to meet in person with top Taliban leadership. The details of the meeting have not been disclosed by the CIA, but experts say the discussion most likely focused on the Aug. 31 deadline for evacuations of U.S. citizens and Afghan allies from Afghanistan. U.S. officials have not confirmed whether an extension is possible; the Taliban gave a "red line" warning this week that an extension would "provoke a reaction."
TITLE=> Democrats to Introduce Legislation to Add Four New Supreme Court Justices. ARTICLE=> Democratic lawmakers plan to introduce legislation that would add four new seats to the Supreme Court. Senator Ed Markey, and Reps. Jerry Nadler, Hank Johnson and Mondaire Jones will hold a press conference to introduce the bill Thursday on the steps of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court can be expanded through Congress, though the Democrats' majorities are slim and many lawmakers oppose the idea; President Joe Biden has said he is "not a fan" of court-packing. This initiative comes after Biden last week signed an executive order establishing a bipartisan commission to look into possible changes to the Supreme Court’s membership, jurisdiction and lifetime terms and report back in six months. The move reflects a battle over the future of the court after former President Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices in four years, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied a vote in 2016 to former President Barack Obama's pick to fill a vacancy, citing an election year. The story received coverage across the political spectrum. Outlets from across the spectrum analyzed the bill's likelihood of passing.

TITLE=> GOP Candidate Beats Trump-Backed Opponent in Texas House Runoff. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, Texas state Rep. Jake Ellzey defeated fellow Republican Susan Wright in a special election runoff for Texas' sixth congressional district. Wright had been widely favored to win. She's the widow of Ron Wright, who previously held the seat, and she had the endorsement of former president Donald Trump. Some political analysts paint the outcome as a loss for Trump and his post-election image; others say the runoff may not have been a clear test of his post-presidency clout because the special election was open to Independents and Democrats.
TITLE=> Lawmaker Sues Trump Over Capitol Violence. ARTICLE=> Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) claimed that former President Donald Trump incited insurrection and attempted to overthrow the 2020 presidential election in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday. The suit, which also names Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and right-wing group The Proud Boys, says Trump sparked the U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6 and conspired to disrupt certification of the election. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and was brought against Trump and the others under the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. The NAACP filed the suit on Thompson's behalf. Trump and his legal team have maintained that he did not incite or conspire to incite the violence at the Capitol. The story was covered more prominently by left- and center-rated sources. Some coverage from left-rated outlets focused more on the case against Trump; some reports from right-rated outlets explained Trump's defense more thoroughly.
TITLE=> Minneapolis Settles Lawsuit with George Floyd's Family for $27 Million. ARTICLE=> The Minneapolis city council voted unanimously Friday to pay a $27 million settlement with the family of George Floyd, who was killed by police officers on May 25. This occurred as jury selection for the murder trial of the former police officer, Derek Chauvin, who killed him. The Floyd family's attorney, Ben Crump, said the settlement, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested, marks the largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in U.S. history. Since Floyd’s death, Minneapolis voted in June to eliminate the city’s police department, though the proposal fell apart months later. The city has implemented changes, however, in their police department, including the prohibition of chokeholds, an overhaul of its use of force, and no longer allowing officers to turn off their body cams while responding to a call. In December, the city council also decided to cut $8 million from the police department’s budget and opted to use the funds for violence prevention; however, in February, the city council voted to approve $6.4 million for more police recruits. The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the settlement and of Chauvin's upcoming trial. Some right-rated outlets also reported that Minneapolis is spending around $36 million to provide extra security to the city during Chauvin's trial while protestors turn the site of Floyd's memorial to a police-free "autonomous zone."
TITLE=> Pompeo Says US "No Longer" Considers Hong Kong Autonomous From China. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that the U.S. no longer considers Hong Kong autonomous from China. The move comes amid escalated tensions between the Trump administration and China, given high-stakes trade negotiations, the latter's management of COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and a recently floated Chinese law that would reportedly crack down on civil liberties for Hong Kong residents. Most outlets, regardless of bias, speculated about the effects the move could have on geopolitical relations and Hong Kong's standing in the global economy. Some compared the China and Hong Kong situation to India and Kashmir's situation, and differences in U.S. policy pertaining to each.
TITLE=> US Senate Approves Tax Bill. ARTICLE=> The Senate early Wednesday passed the Republicans’ $1.5 trillion tax-cut plan, putting it closer to President Trump’s desk with an additional House vote expected Wednesday.
TITLE=> Biden Leads Election Polls, Media Urges Caution After 2016 Election. ARTICLE=> A new CBS/YouGov poll suggests that President Donald Trump is having difficulty holding onto states he previously won, including Arizona, Florida and Texas. Other polls put Joe Biden at an overall lead of 9.4 percent. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum, however, urged readers to take the numbers with a grain of salt, pointing to Hillary Clinton's leading election polls in 2016 as a cautionary tale. Analysis from center- and right-rated outlets highlighted the battleground states where Trump won by a marginal Electoral College vote, and the way polls are changing to include more non-college graduates and late deciders. On Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures, Donald Trump Jr. said he thought his father's drop in the polls was due to unfavorable media coverage, and alleged that Biden's newly-released economic plan borrowed from Trump's economic plan.
TITLE=> Analysis of Georgia Election. ARTICLE=> The result left President Trump and other Republicans crowing and Democrats shaking their heads.
TITLE=> Trump Says All Americans Will Have Vaccine Access by April; Fauci Estimates Mid-Summer. ARTICLE=> Speaking about a vaccine to treat the COVID-19 coronavirus, President Donald Trump said at a Friday briefing "we expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April." Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a Thursday interview the vaccine "very likely would be" available to everyone "in the first half to the third quarter of 2021," a projection echoed earlier by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some coverage from left-rated sources focused on the contradiction between Trump and Fauci's estimations, citing examples of predictions from other experts and sources that align more with Fauci's. Some reports from right-rated outlets concentrated more on the optimism Trump expressed during the briefing and the White House projection that 100 million vaccine doses will be ready by the end of 2020. Some coverage concentrated on the effectiveness of the vaccine testing process, including how clinical trials are seeking out diverse groups; other analysis broke down purported incompetence by public health officials and politicians in conveying effective and practical virus guidelines.
TITLE=> Trump's 'Liberate' Tweets Spark Controversy. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's call for protesters to "liberate" states instituting coronavirus lockdown measures sparked widespread controversy on social media and elsewhere on Friday, a day after the Republican announced steps to reopen the nation's economy. In a series of all-caps tweets, Trump singled out three states -- namely, Virginia, Michigan, and Minnesota -- where largely conservative demonstrators have pushed back against non-essential business closures and other policies that they argue are hurting local economies. Many left and center outlets sought to highlight the divisive nature of Trump's tweets, which come amid the administration's efforts to put the country on a path back to normalcy amid the pandemic. Fewer right-rated sources covered the story as of Saturday morning, though those that did focused more on social media reactions.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Caring for Children in a Pandemic. ARTICLE=> Children, while generally less susceptible to COVID-19 coronavirus effects than the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions, remain a focus as communities and economies move to reopen safely in the face of a global pandemic. Some left-rated voices focused more on potential physical and safety risks posed to children by going back to school, daycare or other regular activities. Some right-rated voices concentrated more on potential psychological consequences for children, who may lack a fully effective system for learning remotely; others explored purported issues with the education system and academic funding as a whole, and how those issues have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis.
TITLE=> Trump Budget Plan. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration's new budget blueprint aims to quantify the president's nationalistic agenda in dollars and cents. The plan, released Thursday morning, calls for significant increases in military and border-security spending, along with corresponding cuts in many other parts of the government.

TITLE=> Perspectives: “Voter Suppression” or “Election Integrity”?. ARTICLE=> Voting rights have become a hot issue in D.C. and around the country, with Republican state lawmakers seeking to pass at least 253 “election integrity” bills in 43 states while Democrats in Congress try to pass “voting rights” bills nationally. One particular hotspot is Georgia, where Republicans are pushing dozens of “election integrity” bills in a state where narrow victories in 2020 gave Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. At the national level, President Joe Biden signed a “voting rights” executive order on Sunday, and Democrats in the House passed H.R. 1, a major election reform bill, on Wednesday. Voices in left-rated outlets mostly characterized Republican state bills as “voter suppression” and in some cases criticized them as racist. Voices in right-rated outlets mostly focused on Democrats’ national efforts, like H.R. 1, and criticized them as “authoritarian” and “partisan.”
TITLE=> Experimental Drug Shows Promise as Possible Coronavirus Treatment. ARTICLE=> Remdisivir, an experimental anti-viral drug, has reportedly generated "positive" data in tests run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to examine its potential as a COVID-19 coronavirus treatment. Dr. Anthony Fauci and President Donald Trump were among those who celebrated the "good news" Wednesday; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is discussing plans with Gilead Sciences, remdisivir's developer, to make the drug publicly available pending an emergency use authorization. Reporting from throughout the spectrum focused on top officials' reserved optimism regarding the test results, specific details of the experiments and how the drug purportedly works, and an ensuing uptick for the stock market.
TITLE=> Officials Cast Doubt on Second Coronavirus Wave as Cases Rise in Some States. ARTICLE=> As some states soften lockdown restrictions and see upticks in the number of coronavirus cases, many are concerned about a potential 'second wave' of the virus this fall. However, Anthony Fauci said Friday that the increase in cases did not necessarily indicate a 'second wave,' and that a spike in the fall could be avoided if people continue to social distance and wear masks in public. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum reported on Fauci's remarks. Coverage from the right also connected coronavirus 'second wave' concern to last week's stock market dip, as well as White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow's repeated denial of the 'second wave.'
TITLE=> Search Crews Return After Rest of Surfside Condo Building is Demolished. ARTICLE=> Search crews will return to the site of the collapsed Miami condo building Monday after the remaining section is demolished.

TITLE=> President Trump Proposes $7 Billion Cut to Children's Health Insurance Program. ARTICLE=> President Trump has proposed cutting $7 billion from the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as a part of the $15 billion spending clawback. Many on the Left have come out against the proposal saying that it will hurt low-income families. However, some on the Right point out that a large portion of that CHIP funding ($5 billion) is 2017 funding that has expired, and that Democrats previously agreed to rescind CHIP funding as a part of the March omnibus.
TITLE=> Clinton Foundation May Restrict Donations. ARTICLE=> Amid growing criticism about foreign and corporation donations while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation will no longer accept those kinds of donations if Hillary Clinton is election President.
TITLE=> Kavanaugh hearings: Political Ambush or Reasonable Delay?. ARTICLE=> The last minute public accusations of sexual impropriety while in high school by Brett Kavanaugh has some arguing that this is an unfair political ambush by those who will stop at nothing to oppose him while others argue it is reasonable and responsible to continue the hearings for this Supreme Court nominee.
TITLE=> Analyzing Health Care Defeat. ARTICLE=> Pundits from the right, left, and center analyze why Trump lost the health care debate. Was there no way to satisfy both GOP conservatives and moderates? Did Trump lack the detailed health care knowledge and relationships that we needed to close the deal? Or was it mostly a matter of losing the narrative on how benefited the most from AHCA?
TITLE=> Majority of NY Legislators Call on Cuomo to Resign as Impeachment Inquiry Opens. ARTICLE=> A majority of New York state legislators called for Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign this week, police in the state's capital are preparing to investigate allegations that he sexually harassed a former aide, and state lawmakers are opening an impeachment inquiry into him. Cuomo says he won't resign and has continually denied the harassment claims; the impeachment inquiry will investigate those accusations, and the Cuomo administration's misrepresentation of COVID-19 deaths in state nursing homes. At least 121 members of the state Assembly and Senate have reportedly said Cuomo should resign, including 65 Democrats and 56 Republicans. The situation received coverage throughout the spectrum; reports focused on the sexual harassment allegations themselves, the state legislature's impeachment inquiry, and Cuomo's denial of the claims. Some outlets on the right, particularly Fox News, have covered the news much more prominently than left- and center-rated outlets in recent weeks.
TITLE=> Biden Administration Transfers its First Detainee From Guantanamo Bay. ARTICLE=> On Monday morning, the Department of Defense announced the transfer of a detainee from Guantanamo Bay to his home country of Morocco. The move represented a policy change from the Trump administration as President Biden is reported to be starting efforts to close the detention facility. The facility was opened under former President George W. Bush in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks.
TITLE=> U.S. Starts Formal Withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump sent a letter to the United Nations indicating his administration's intention to formally pull out of the Paris climate accord, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter Monday. The process is set to take exactly a year, and end a day after the 2020 presidential election. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. entered the deal in 2015 by committing to a 26-28 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, retroactive to 2005. Trump has promised to leave the accord since his 2016 presidential campaign, calling the deal unfair for the U.S. economy; the U.S. government is the only government in the world that publicly denounces the agreement.
TITLE=> US Officials Briefed on Soon-to-be-Public UFO Reports. ARTICLE=> United States defense officials and lawmakers were recently briefed on materials retrieved from “off-world vehicles not made on this earth,” The New York Times reported Thursday. In April, the Pentagon released three previously classified videos of “unexplained aerial phenomena.” Both the videos and the briefings are part of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force, which according to Times is meant to “to standardize collection and reporting” on sightings of unexplained aerial vehicles. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum analyzed the unit's history of dealing with unidentified flying objects, and highlighted statements from acting intelligence committee chairman Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) calling for the info's release. The news also caused a stir on social media, with some questioning the timing of the release of both the UFO footage in April and the briefings this month, and speculating about a possible government conspiracy.
TITLE=> People Demonstrate Against Vaccine Passports in Protests Across France. ARTICLE=> Over the last four weekends, thousands of protesters have rallied in the streets across France to revolt against President Emmanuel Macron's new vaccine passport mandate. The health bill, which goes into effect tomorrow, will require all French citizens to show proof of vaccination before entering cafes, restaurants, public transportation and certain health facilities. The law was already in effect for cultural and recreational venues with a capacity for more than 50 people. While there has been little opposition to wearing face masks, many French citizens believe the bill infringes the most fundamental of French principles: the liberté (freedom) and egalité (equality) of the national motto. Macron asked his people to consider the third element of the motto, fraternité (fraternity), and to “accept these collective rules … and get vaccinated.” Many other European countries such as Italy, Denmark, Germany and Austria have introduced COVID-19 passes, each with different rules. While the U.S. and Canada have no current plans to implement a federal vaccine mandate, certain areas like New York City and Quebec have moved forward with their own requirements. Right-rated outlets were more likely to include quotes from protesters; left-rated outlets featured more quotes from Macron and health officials. Left-rated outlets were also more likely to link back to polls that report most people in France support the vaccine passport. Some right-rated outlets referred to COVID-19 as the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus.
TITLE=> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Heralds Progress With North Korea. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heralds progress with North Korea, revealing that Chairman Kim Jong Un has agreed to allow international inspectors to survey their nuclear and missile testing sites.
TITLE=> Andrew Puzder Chosen for Labor. ARTICLE=> Andy Puzder, the chief executive of the company that owns the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains, is one of the nation’s most effective spokesmen for the rights and privileges of fast-food franchisers. But as a spokesman for the rights of workers, especially the low-wage workers employed in his chains, he doesn’t rank.
TITLE=> Trump Considers Revoking Obama Intel Officials' Security Clearances. ARTICLE=> President Trump is considering revoking security clearances from former U.S. intelligence officials who have criticized him over his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his handling of the Russia probe, including former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI director James Comey. "Making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the president is extremely inappropriate," said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
TITLE=> House Democrat to Investigate Mike Pompeo's RNC Speech. ARTICLE=> A House Democrat announced plans to launch an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Republican National Convention (RNC) speech on Tuesday. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of a Foreign Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations, expressed concerns in a letter that Pompeo's speech is an illegal violation of the Hatch Act and a breach of State Department regulations. The Hatch Act broadly prohibits all employees in the executive branch of the federal government, except the president and vice president, from engaging in some forms of political activity. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows defended Pompeo's speech in a Politico segment on Wednesday, saying that "he made it very clear he was talking in his personal capacity, used no federal assets to do that." Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight critics framing Pompeo's speech as "unprecedented" and "wrong"; some also pointed out that Meadows was once a supporter of the Hatch Act. Some voices from the left also speculated that Pompeo's speech location was chosen to appeal to evangelical voters who support the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocating the U.S. Embassy. Coverage of Pompeo's speech from the right tended to focus on the details of the speech, with some noting that the speech "broke with tradition." Some voices from the right compared Pompeo's speech to Barack Obama and Joe Biden's open criticism of Trump from foreign soil in 2016.
TITLE=> ABC Anchor Amy Robach Says Network Suppressed Jeffrey Epstein Reporting. ARTICLE=> Conservative watchdog Project Veritas released video Tuesday of ABC News anchor Amy Robach saying the network suppressed her reporting on Jeffrey Epstein. The video, apparently provided by an unnamed ABC employee, shows Robach last summer alleging to an unseen audience that she connected Epstein to Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family, and that ABC avoided the story after the Palace threatened to stop doing interviews with the network. Only right-leaning publications covered the story initially, with more left and center-rated coverage coming as the day progressed. Robach and ABC released separate statements on the video; Robach said she was caught in a "private moment of frustration", and ABC said Robach's reporting did not meet ethical standards.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Coronavirus, Police Reform and US Polarization. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, racial tension, violence and widespread calls for police reform have recently highlighted polarization in the United States. Some voices have investigated the intersection of such polarization with the criminal justice system, as well as public health, especially as it relates to mask-wearing during the pandemic. Voices on all sides addressed the apparent severity of present-day polarization and what should be or is being done about it. Some left-rated voices expressed skepticism that the country's social fabric could withstand the current tension much longer; some right-rated voices pointed to areas where Americans are in agreement, particularly on police reform. To many, political polarization in the U.S. may feel as though it's intensifying — one recent study from Penn State supports that notion.
TITLE=> Fauci Says US Can Have COVID-19 Under Control by Spring if Vaccinations Rise. ARTICLE=> In an interview with CNN (Left bias) Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci predicted that the U.S. could "get some good control" of COVID-19 by next spring if vaccination rates rise. Fauci said that "If we keep lingering without getting those people vaccinated that should be vaccinated, this thing could linger on, leading to the development of another variant which could complicate things." Roughly 90 million eligible Americans have not received the COVID-19 vaccine. Fauci added: "“I respect people’s freedom, but when you’re talking about a public health crisis that we’ve been going through now for well over a year and a half, the time has come." Fauci also apologized for and corrected a prediction he made in an NPR interview Monday, in which he predicted better control of the pandemic "into the fall and the winter" rather than Spring 2022. 	Fauci's interview was covered across the spectrum. Some left-rated sources framed his comments as a sign that defeating the pandemic requires continued action from the federal government and public health officials, such as vaccine mandates; others covered how the prediction may create issues for Biden and Democrats. Some right-rated outlets focused more on Fauci's correction, framing it as another example of inconsistent government messaging on COVID-19.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Ends Eviction Moratorium With 6-3 Vote. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court voted 6-3 Thursday to end a federal eviction moratorium that was recently extended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The eviction freeze applied to parts of the country experiencing significant COVID-19 spread; the CDC extended it on Aug. 3 to run through Oct. 3, bypassing Congressional approval. The majority of the court agreed that "...It is up to Congress, not the CDC, to decide whether the public interest merits further action here." White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that the White House is disappointed by the ruling and calls on "cities and states, local courts, landlords, Cabinet agencies...to urgently act to prevent evictions." The high court's decision stemmed from a legal challenge to the extension mounted by landlords and real estate groups. 	The news was covered prominently across the spectrum, but especially by left- and center-rated outlets. Coverage often differed significantly between left and right. Reports from left-rated sources often framed the Supreme Court's decision as questionable in the context of the pandemic, and focused on people who have struggled to make rent payments since the pandemic began. Coverage from right-rated outlets often highlighted that the extended ban did not have Congressional approval, as well as struggling landlords who have lost money during the moratorium.
TITLE=> US Daily New COVID-19 Cases Drop Below 30,000. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, daily new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. fell below 30,000 for the first time since June 2020. There were 29,128 new virus cases and 669 COVID-related deaths in the U.S. on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University; the seven-day average dropped to 27,815 on Friday, according to data compiled by The Washington Post.  Coverage from across the spectrum tended to note Americans' growing optimism at the COVID-19 numbers while still highlighting public health guidelines. 
TITLE=> Report: Some Members of Congress Benefited From PPP Loan Program. ARTICLE=> According to a report first published by Politico, at least four members of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — benefited from the Paycheck Protection Program that was designed to allow small businesses to keep paying their employees during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The report raised speculation about a potential conflict of interest in future legislation. The four named in the report are Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX), Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO), Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), and Rep. Debbie Mucarsel Powell (D-FL). Reporting from across the spectrum largely focused on the potential conflict of interest and Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin's potential actions to better the Small Business Administration's (SBA) transparency without divulging sensitive information.
TITLE=> US, Taliban Sign Historic Peace Deal. ARTICLE=> U.S. officials and top representatives of Afghanistan's Taliban signed a historic peace treaty in Qatar on Saturday, ultimately paving the way for a final end to the 18-year war in the Middle Eastern nation. The deal, which follows months of negotiations between the two parties, calls for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops over the next 14 months in exchange for the Taliban's pledge to work with the Afghan government. Outlets on both sides of the aisle framed the signing as "historic" and the beginning of the end of the U.S.'s longest-running war, which began in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks. But the deal has also drawn criticism -- including from right-leaning voices, who argue that it concedes too much to the terrorism-linked political organization.
TITLE=> Ukraine Opens Investigation Into Reports Of Surveillance Of Marie Yovanovitch. ARTICLE=> Ukrainian police have opened an investigation into whether or not U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch came under surveillance before she was recalled from her post in Ukraine last May.

TITLE=> Preview of Thursday's 2020 Presidential Debate. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will face off in their final debate Thursday, less than two weeks ahead of the presidential election. The candidates held their town halls last week after the second debate was cancelled. This debate will be moderated by NBC White House correspondent Kristen Welker; candidates will have their microphones muted while their opponent speaks after frequent interruptions during the first debate. Each nominee will be muted while his opponent has two minutes to speak on each of the six debate topics; fighting COVID-19, American families, race in America, climate change, national security and leadership. The remainder of each 15-minute block is open for discussion. Ahead of the debate, many outlets, especially from the right, are focused on Welker and the microphones being muted. Some coverage from right-rated sources framed Welker as biased; some coverage from left-rated sources concentrated more on Trump's criticisms of her, often framing those criticisms as "attacks."
TITLE=> Amazon Offers Vaccine Distribution Aid to Biden Administration. ARTICLE=> Amazon offered to help the Biden administration with its COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts in a letter sent to President Joe Biden on Wednesday. In the letter, Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Dave Clark wrote that “we are prepared to leverage our operations, information technology, and communications capabilities and expertise to assist your administration’s vaccination efforts.” Clark also wrote that Amazon’s “essential employees” who cannot work from home “should receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time.” Biden has pledged to vaccinate 100 million Americans in his first 100 days, in part by using the Defense Production Act, which authorizes the president to require businesses to prioritize contracts deemed necessary for national defense. Coverage in some right-rated outlets, particularly Fox News, focused on the timing of Amazon's offer at the beginning of Biden's term. Coverage in some left-rated outlets, particularly CNN, focused on Clark’s request to prioritize essential Amazon workers for vaccination. However, most coverage on all sides focused on the letter itself and the promise of assistance.
TITLE=> Twitter Targets COVID-19 Misinformation With Labels, Strike System. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Twitter said it will begin labeling COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on its site. The platform also introduced a strike system for accounts that repeatedly violate the rules; one strike is a warning, second and third strikes result in a 12-hour account lock, a fourth strike is a weeklong lock on the account, and five strikes results in permanent suspension. This comes after Twitter decided to remove posts containing “the most harmful misleading information” about coronavirus vaccines in December. According to Twitter, the policy will remove tweets which "advance harmful false or misleading narratives about COVID-19 vaccinations." The Washington Examiner reported that since introducing the policy in December, Twitter has removed more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts worldwide. Initially, labels will initially be enforced by Twitter team members only, which will help automated systems pick up on violating content; eventually, Twitter will use both automated and human review to flag misleading information. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets tended to highlight the different types of COVID-19 misinformation on social media. Some right-rated outlets tended to highlight the number of accounts removed or challenged by Twitter, as well as the various partnerships Twitter has done with UNICEF, the Vaccine Confidence Project, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Dr. Anthony Fauci to combat COVID-19 misinformation.
TITLE=> Calls Grow for Investigation Into Capitol Riot. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, Congressional Republicans and Democrats expressed approval for a commission to look into the events surrounding the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. There is disagreement, however, on whether to focus on Trump's role in the riot, or on "pre-planned elements" that may have led to the violence that left five people dead.
TITLE=> Bernie Sanders Undergoes Emergency Heart Procedure. ARTICLE=> Senator Bernie Sanders successfully had two stents inserted after experiencing chest pain during a Tuesday campaign event in Nevada.

This is not an endorsement for any candidate.
TITLE=> Senate Democrats Raise Concerns Over FBI's Handling of 4,500 Kavanaugh Tips. ARTICLE=> Seven Democratic senators questioned the FBI’s supplemental investigation of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 after a letter from FBI Assistant Director Jill Tyson said the FBI received 4,500 tips and had provided all “relevant” ones to the Trump White House. The senators said that Tyson’s letter, sent on June 30 to Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), “confirms that the FBI’s tip line was a departure from past practice and that the FBI was politically constrained by the Trump White House.” Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who alleged Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said the letter showed the investigation to be a “sham.” Kavanaugh has denied Blasey Ford’s allegations.  Coverage in right-rated outlets often framed Democrat’s statements as “attacks,” with some coverage calling Blasey Ford’s allegations ”dubious”; one outlet quoted a Republican senator criticizing Whitehouse’s “obsession” with the Kavanaugh case. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to focus on the FBI letter itself. While some right-rated outlets included past statements by Republicans, outlets across the spectrum mostly quoted present-day statements by Democratic senators and Blasey Ford’s lawyers.

TITLE=> Pro Football Season Starts; Social Justice Messages, Demonstrations Take Center Stage. ARTICLE=> The National Football League (NFL) kicked off its 2020 season Thursday night with the ongoing social justice and Black Lives Matter movements as a constant theme. The game between the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs was preceded by on-field demonstrations from players, as well as television promotions and advertising campaigns, all advocating social and racial justice. Reporting from many right-rated outlets focused particularly on the apparent 16% decline in TV ratings between Thursday's game and the NFL's 2019 season opener. Some reports from left-rated outlets concentrated on displeasure expressed by some fans in the stands during portions of the on-field demonstrations.
TITLE=> New York Sues National Rifle Association For Corruption. ARTICLE=> New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the National Rifle Association (NRA) on Thursday, citing "years of self-dealing and illegal conduct." An accompanying press release said that after an 18-month investigation, the attorney general is suing the organization and four of its leaders for allegedly diverting millions of dollars for personal use and to buy the silence of friends and former employees. NRA president Carolyn Meadows said the group was counter-suing the New York attorney general's office, calling it "a transparent attempt to score political points and attack the leading voice in opposition to the leftist agenda." President Donald Trump called the lawsuit "a very terrible thing" and suggested that the NRA move its headquarters to Texas on Thursday. As of Thursday, there has been consistent coverage of this story from all sides of the political spectrum. Some coverage from left-rated outlets provided detailed analyses of the NRA's leadership and the alleged crimes they committed.

TITLE=> House Panel Approves Procedures For Trump Impeachment Probe. ARTICLE=> The House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution defining the rules of the panel's impeachment investigation. The vote gives Chairman Jerry Nadler the ability to deem committee hearings as impeachment hearings, and staff can question witnesses.

TITLE=> Vaccine Distribution Continues, Alongside Concerns About Access. ARTICLE=> The U.S. has reportedly administered over 2 million doses of COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines as of Tuesday, roughly three weeks after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccines for emergency use. Coverage from all sides has highlighted vaccine distribution and potential obstacles to it, as well as remarks from federal officials that the process has at times been slower and less organized than expected. Some coverage from left-rated sources focused primarily on the fact that the Trump administration pledged to vaccinate 20 million people before year's end, which will not happen; other reports concentrated on Biden's criticism of Trump's vaccine strategy.
TITLE=> Trump Signs Spending Bill. ARTICLE=> President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Friday after earlier saying that he might veto the bill.

TITLE=> Trump Told Georgia Official He Wanted to "Find" Votes to Overturn Election. ARTICLE=> In a phone call on Saturday, President Donald Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, "I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state." Trump also claimed to Raffensperger that Georgia's vote count was off "by hundreds of thousands of votes." Controversy followed once part of the phone call was made public; many on the left accused Trump of illegally trying to manipulate the election results, and some on the right were critical of Raffensperger's office for allowing the audio to go public. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) said he doesn't think the call will affect Tuesday's runoff election in Georgia, which will decide the party that will the U.S. Senate. Listen to the call and read the transcript here. Coverage was more prominent from left- and center-rated sources. Reports from many right-rated outlets focused on the fact that the audio was leaked, with some painting that as evidence of Raffensperger's bias against Trump. Most reports from left- and center-rated sources said Trump "pressured" Raffensperger, and framed the call as potential evidence of Trump illegally trying to influence the 2020 election results based on false or unproven claims.
TITLE=> US Jobless Claims Rose to 412,000 Last Week. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 412,000 last week, the first increase since April.

The tweets were directed toward Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Many left-leaning media outlets said many GOP lawmakers had yet to comment on the tweets. Some right-leaning media outlets pointed out individual GOP lawmakers who had commented on the tweets.

Meadows' remarks come after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that economic stimulus talks are stalled after a roughly 25-minute phone conversation with Meadows.

Negotiations on the fifth package began in July, when Senate Republicans proposed a $1.1 trillion. There are currently no details as to how the money would be distributed among Americans. As of Friday afternoon, coverage from all sides of the political spectrum remain consistent.

ARTICLE=> Mount Rushmore is the center of debate about American history and racism ahead of the Fourth of July festivities President Donald Trump has planned at the memorial. The New York Times published an article Wednesday exploring the monument's history, pointing out its existence on sacred Native American land and that some of the Founding Fathers it commemorates were tied to slavery and racial oppression. The Times article was criticized by many right-rated voices, who framed the piece as an effort to cancel the monument and sow discontent; some pointed out how New York City's expansion encroached on Native American territory. Other reports focused on Native American reactions to Trump's planned visit, and controversy about the monument's location; the Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that the land had been illegally taken from the Lakota Sioux tribe.

The White House later clarified that Trump was suggesting voters “go verify that [their absentee ballot] has been received and counted.” Coverage in left-rated outlets tended to put Trump’s comments in context with his past statements on election security issues. Coverage in right-rated outlets was less frequent and focused on Trump’s stated intention of getting voters to test the efficacy of the system, rather than to commit deliberate voter fraud.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Lets North Dakota Voter ID Law Stand.

ARTICLE=> Under a new U.S.-Honduras immigration deal, the Central American country will accept more migrants who seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is part of the 'safe third country' policy that the Trump administration has implemented to curb an influx of Central American migrants. The deal with Honduras is similar to others made with El Salvador last week and Guatemala in July; numerous lawsuits have targeted these policies, but they continue to be enforced as legal disputes continue. Some left-leaning voices have rebuked the Supreme Court ruling, saying the justices have compromised the lives of thousands of refugees. Some on the right lauded the policy as a supposedly humane solution to undocumented immigration; others remain critical of Trump's handling of immigration.

TITLE=> U.S. House Passes $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Bill. ARTICLE=> The House of Representatives passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package, which includes a $15 federal minimum wage mandate, early Saturday morning. House Democrats passed the bill with a 219-212 vote, with two Democrats joining every Republican in voting against it. The bill includes a third round of $1,400 stimulus checks, a $400 weekly unemployment insurance boost through Aug. 29, and $8.5 billion to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. It would also include $350 billion for state and local governments, $130 billion for school reopenings, and an expansion of the child tax credit to $3,000 per child. Though the Senate ruled Thursday that the minimum wage provision was not compliant with Congress' rules governing the budget process, the House bill currently includes the minimum wage mandate. The bill will now move on to the Senate, where the bill will be amended and the Democratic majority will likely face pressure over the minimum wage increase. After that, it will be sent back to the House for approval before unemployment insurance benefits expire on March 14. The bill received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum.

Todd played a clip of a CBS interview in which Barr was asked about the decision, and followed the clip by criticizing Barr's statements. However, it was later revealed that the audio of Barr had been shortened, rendering his statement out of context. The removed portion of Barr's quote would have immediately undermined Todd's criticism. NBC later apologized, acknowledging that the clip was not Barr's full answer. As of midday Monday, some center-rated and few left-rated outlets have covered the story; right-rated outlets have covered it prominently. Right-rated outlets called the edited clip "deceptive"; conversely, some left-rated outlets describe the quote as "abbreviated" and focused more on President Trump's calls for Todd to be fired. Some center-rated journalism ethicists were critical of NBC for supposedly misleading audiences.
TITLE=> McConnell Says He Hasn’t Spoken With Biden Since the Inauguration. ARTICLE=> Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that he had not spoken with President Joe Biden since Biden’s inauguration. “I haven't been invited to the White House.

McConnell has spoken with Biden at least once since the inauguration, telling reporters on Feb. 2 that he had talked with Biden “yesterday morning” about “Burma...the budget process and COVID relief.” Several commentators following the 2020 election expected Biden and McConnell’s long history in the Senate to make their relationship key during the Biden administration. Coverage in some left-rated outlets said McConnell was “complaining” or “whining” about not speaking with Biden. Coverage in right-rated outlets was more common and tended to frame Biden’s lack of conversation with McConnell as a reversal of his earlier “unity” messaging.

TITLE=> Joe Biden Names Kamala Harris as Running Mate. ARTICLE=> Former vice president and presumptive democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris (CA) as his running mate in a tweet on Tuesday.

In June, Biden promised to pick a woman of color as vice president; over the past few weeks, speculation swirled around Harris as Biden's vice president pick after a photograph of Biden's notes revealed Harris' name among the list of talking points, along with the phrase "do not hold grudges." Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum analyzed what this pick could mean for Biden's chances in November. Coverage from the left tended to highlight the fact that if the Biden-Harris ticket succeeds, Harris would be the first woman and the second person of color in U.S. history to be vice president or president. Some voices noted that several different left- and center-rated news outlets referred to Harris in their headlines as a "woman of color," and a "black woman," while others referred to her South Asian heritage.

Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a recent interview that when the share of the U.S. population that's been vaccinated gets "to somewhere between 40 and 50%, I believe you’re going to start seeing real change, the start of a precipitous drop in cases." As of Monday, nearly 40% of Americans have been fully vaccinated. The positive trend has made headlines across the spectrum, with more prominent coverage coming from right-rated outlets.

The earnings report comes as calls grow to waive coronavirus vaccine patents, which would allow countries to manufacture the life-saving vaccines while cutting profits for Pfizer and Moderna; AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have pledged not to profit off of their vaccines.  Coverage was less common in right-rated outlets and more prominently featured in business-focused outlets. Coverage in some left-rated outlets discussed related issues like global vaccine distribution and pricing.
TITLE=> DOJ Investigation Finds Flaws in FBI's Carter Page Probe, No Evidence of Bias. ARTICLE=> A Department of Justice investigation of the FBI's investigation into a former campaign official for President Donald Trump said the bureau made over a dozen "significant errors", but concluded by finding no evidence of political bias in the probe. Inspector General Michael Horowtiz's investigation was met with criticism from John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who's conducting a separate review of the origins of the FBI's Russia probe. Left-rated voices gave more weight to the lack of political bias found in the investigation; right-rated coverage focused more on the FBI's procedural violations.
TITLE=> Trump is Happy with Jobs Report. ARTICLE=> The Trump Administration is happy with the February jobs report, saying that it's "real" whereas the ones under Obama were "fake".
TITLE=> Dallas Shooting Kills At Least 5 Cops. ARTICLE=> A suspect who died after a standoff with police said he wanted to kill white people - especially white officers.
TITLE=> Facebook Undergoes Independent Civil Rights Audit. ARTICLE=> Facebook underwent an independent audit regarding the progress it has made in protecting civil rights, including in counteracting hateful speech. This comes as some companies have mounted an advertising boycott of the social media platform in protest of what they argue to be lacking regulations on hateful speech and conduct. Right-rated voices were more likely to laud Facebook for purportedly not submitting to pressure to censor free speech. Left-rated voices were more likely to condemn Facebook and show support for the boycott, arguing that the company is not using its full power to fight purported misuse of its platform.
TITLE=> May Jobs Report Better Than Expected. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy added a record 2.5 million jobs in May, after losing more than 22 million jobs between March and April, while the national unemployment rate dropped from 14.7% in April to 13.3%. Experts widely projected the economy to lose roughly eight million more jobs in May, and for the unemployment rate to approach 20%. Media on all sides framed the report as surprisingly positive, with coverage from right-rated outlets generally crediting relaxed lockdowns for the encouraging numbers and praising a seemingly faster-than-expected economic rebound. Many reports, especially from left-rated outlets, also focused on the fact that 13.3% is still a very high unemployment rate.
TITLE=> Speaker Nancy Pelosi Calls For Articles Of Impeachment. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has instructed the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump over his effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. President Trump has asked House Democrats to impeach him quickly so that he can get past the Senate trial and "get back to work."
TITLE=> Trump Restricts Travel From Six New Countries. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday that extends his administration's travel ban to six new countries, including Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar. Under the ban, citizens from those countries will be barred from obtaining certain types of visas, though they will still be able to visit the US as tourists. The administration has argued that the countries targeted pose a threat because they failed to "satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America’s law-enforcement and intelligence professionals." Outlets on both sides of the aisle characterized the move as an expansion of Trump's controversial 2017 travel ban, which continues to affect countries like Iran, Libya, Somalia, and North Korea. Left-leaning outlets noted that both bans target countries with large Muslim populations.
TITLE=> 22 states sue Trump administration for cutting power plant regulations. ARTICLE=> Attorneys general from 22 states and seven cities have sued the Trump administration in response to proposed rollbacks of the Clean Power Plan, a rule passed during Barack Obama's presidency meant to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The new Affordable Clean Energy rule is described as giving states more power and time to address emissions. Media coverage was significantly divided on this story. Many left-leaning outlets focused on the perceived perks of the Obama-era rule and the consequences a rollback may have, suggesting that the new rule will extend and worsen carbon emissions; most right-leaning outlets focused on perceived issues with the old regulations, and described the new rule as a win for conservative states.
TITLE=> Justice Department Says IRS Must Release Trump Tax Returns to Congress. ARTICLE=> The Treasury Department must release former President Donald Trump’s tax returns to the Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel said Friday. Acting Assistant Attorney General Dawn Johnsen wrote in a memo that the committee had “invoked sufficient reasons for requesting the former President’s tax information,” satisfying the requirement that tax information requested from the executive branch serve a “legitimate legal purpose.” Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who chairs the committee, originally requested the documents in 2019 for the stated purpose of studying the IRS’ mandatory presidential audit program. However, the Trump Justice Department ruled that the committee’s request was politically motivated; thus, the Trump administration refused to release the records and ignored a subpoena, prompting the House to file a lawsuit. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with coverage in left-rated outlets slightly more likely to bring up Rep. Neal’s subpoenas than coverage in right-rated outlets. While most headlines across the spectrum used forceful language to convey that the Treasury “must” hand over the documents, headlines in Fox News and Bloomberg said that the the Treasury “can” release the documents.
TITLE=> Interest Rate Hike Could Come Soon. ARTICLE=> Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said in prepared remarks Thursday that the Fed could raise interest rates "relatively soon," and she will make the same indication to Congress today. The Fed last raised its key interest rate in December 2015 for the first time in a nearly decade.
TITLE=> US Consumer Prices Rise by the Most Since 2008. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) has jumped 5.4% since last June, according to the Labor Department.  This jump marks the sharpest 12-month inflation spike since 2008. Businesses continue to recover from the impact of the coronavirus, as some face labor shortages, supply shortages and higher shipping rates. Meanwhile, the demand for products and services is growing as some businesses struggle to keep up.
TITLE=> Senate Passes Bill to Make Juneteenth A National Holiday. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the Senate unanimously approved a bill that would make June 19, or Juneteenth, a federal holiday. Though President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation years prior in 1862, June 19, 1865 marks the anniversary of when the final enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The recognition of Juneteenth as a national holiday comes amid a larger national movement examining race and racism in American history. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 60 senators; Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reportedly asked senators to unanimously pass the bill, and no senator objected. The bill received wide praise from lawmakers across the political aisle, including the bill's lead GOP sponsor Sen. John Cornyn (R.-Tx.) and Schumer. This comes after Sen. Ron Johnson (R.-Wis.) clarified that he did not intend to block the bill, though he criticized the “cost and lack of the debate,” and said he thought it was "kind of odd" that "apparently the only way to do that is to give 2 million federal workers a paid day off, cost American taxpayers $600 million.” The bill will now move onto the Democratic-led U.S. House.  The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum; outlets often highlighted the bipartisan nature of the bill, the history of Juneteenth and the recent movement surrounding racial justice.
TITLE=> Suspected Chinese Spy Targeted US Politicians Including Eric Swalwell. ARTICLE=> A suspected Chinese spy targeted several political figures around the country from 2011-2015, including California Rep. Eric Swalwell, according to an Axios report published Tuesday. The spy, Fang Fang (or Christine Fang), was discovered in 2015, the same year Swalwell was appointed to the House Intelligence Committee. While other lawmakers were not informed of Swalwell’s relationship to Fang, Axios reports that “U.S. officials do not believe Fang received or passed on classified information.” Swalwell has since suggested that the report was leaked by the Trump administration because of his past criticisms. Coverage came mostly from center- and right-rated outlets, with fewer reports coming from left-rated sources overall. Coverage in right-rated outlets framed the story around Swalwell, focusing on Republican criticisms, Democratic “hypocrisy” and the allegation that Chinese spies aim to trade sexual favors for U.S. intelligence. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets focused on the original report and Swalwell’s suggestion of a Trump administration leak.
TITLE=> Trump Picks Steve Mnuchin for Treasury. ARTICLE=> President-elect Donald Trump has picked his campaign finance chairman, Steve Mnuchin, to be his Treasury secretary. The Wall Street banker spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner, and is now chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a privately owned hedge fund.
TITLE=> Trump Drops Plan To Nominate Ratcliffe. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has dropped his plans to nominate Congressman John Ratcliffe (R-TX) for the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Ratcliffe was the nominee for a week; all after the sudden resignation of former DNI Dan Coats effective yesterday. Critics decried the nomination as partisan and the President playing favorites. To be clear, both President Trump and Rep. Ratcliffe announced that it was Ratcliffe's decision to not accept the nomination. Left-leaning media reflects upon the length of nomination that Ratcliffe had while also speaking out against the nomination at the same time. Some right-leaning media outlets have called the rescinding of the nomination to be reflective of media interference in a political process. This is breaking news, first announced by Ratcliffe via Twitter.
TITLE=> Senate to Vote on Dueling Bills to End Shutdown. ARTICLE=> As the shutdown drags on, the Senate will vote Thursday on two proposals to fund the government. The first would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary legal protections for some immigrants, while the second would reopen the government until Feb. 8 without funding for a wall. Both are expected to fail.
TITLE=> Senate Delays Healthcare Vote. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the scheduled Better Care Act vote would be delayed indefinitely because of McCain's absence.
TITLE=> Trump Administration To Revoke California's Power To Set Auto Emissions Standards. ARTICLE=> The Trump Administration plans to revoke California's power to set stricter air pollution standards for cars and trucks. The Administration says that only the federal government can set fuel standards, according to the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act. California has been relying on a special waiver to set its own emissions standards. This may lead to court battles over the next few years.
TITLE=> Dems and GOP Strike Short-Term Deal on Debt, but Larger Divide Remains. ARTICLE=> Democrats and Republicans have reached a temporary solution to the nation's debt limit dilemma, but the partisan split on how to solve the problem remains.  Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) accepted an offer Thursday from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to raise the debt limit by $480 billion, which is expected to last into December. Eleven Republicans and the 50 Democratic senators voted to break a filibuster on the matter Thursday evening, and the actual measure then passed by a 50-48 party-line vote. It is widely expected to pass the House. Schumer later criticized Republicans, saying "they played a dangerous and risky" game by opposing the debt measure until that point. Republicans say Democrats should use budget reconciliation to raise the debt limit to a fixed amount by themselves, since they hold the majority and already plan to use the process to pass trillions of dollars in new spending. Democratic leaders say they won't, arguing that the process should be bipartisan. The U.S. Treasury previously warned of an economic recession if the limit wasn't boosted by mid-October. Coverage across the spectrum highlighted the remaining partisan divide and ultimately unresolved debt limit issue, as well as Republican disapproval of McConnell's offer; some Republican lawmakers and right-rated voices criticized McConnell for purportedly caving to Democrats. Reports from the right also focused on Republican criticism of Schumer's comments after the speech. 
TITLE=> Perspectives: Bipartisanship in Biden's First 100 Days. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden based part of his 2020 presidential campaign around a unifying message, and the idea that political divisions could be at least partially cured if "enough of us" come together to heal them. 100 days into his administration, many are reflecting on that message and Biden's performance on it so far. Voices throughout the spectrum seem to agree that, at least to date, Biden hasn't accomplished the goals of uniting Americans and working across the aisle that he outlined in his campaign. Some left-rated voices say this is preferable, focusing on partisanship's power as a political tool and arguing that bipartisan collaboration amid intense political polarization "deprives both sides of the ability to govern and elections of their consequences." Some right-rated voices frame Biden's messaging on unity as hypocritical, accusing him of pushing "every priority his party ever failed to get through" while failing to work with Republican legislators. Other voices stress that division is an inevitable part of the political process, and urge Americans to seek their own opportunities to unify and bridge divides.
TITLE=> Nearly 3 Million Americans Filed for Unemployment Benefits Last Week. ARTICLE=> The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits over the last eight weeks has reached 36.5 million, with about 3 million filing jobless claims last week. The data underscores the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus, as dine-in restaurants and retailers remain largely closed and concerned Americans are staying inside.
TITLE=> Watchdog: $1.4 Billion In Stimulus Money Sent to Deceased People. ARTICLE=> Internal Revenue Services (IRS) sent roughly 1 million checks to deceased people, amounting to about $1.4 billion, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office, an independent government watchdog. The IRS did not believe it had the legal authority to withhold the payments, until reversing course for reasons unclear on April 30. The $1.4 billion equals roughly .5% of all the money dolled out in the form of COVID-19 coronavirus stimulus checks. Outlets from across the spectrum have reported similarly on the news.
TITLE=> As US Surpasses 40 Million COVID-19 Cases, Mu Variant Detected Across 49 States. ARTICLE=> The U.S. surpassed 40 million COVID-19 cases on Monday as the highly infectious Delta variant continues to spread across the nation, with more than 4 million infections reported in the last four weeks. The daily death count has also exceeded 1,500 for the first time since March, according to a New York Times (Lean Left bias) tracker. This news comes as the mu variant was detected in 49 states and added to WHO's "variants of interest" list. Fifty-three percent of U.S. citizens are currently fully vaccinated while 62.5% have received at least one shot, according to the CDC’s vaccination tracker. Left-rated outlets were more likely to suggest that the fourth wave has "overwhelmed hospitals" and link to data from the CDC that suggests the 40 million statistic is actually an undercount. Right-rated outlets highlighted how Fauci said the mu variant was "not an immediate threat" on Sunday and that COVID-19 cases are declining in the U.S. for the first time since June.
TITLE=> Trump Grants 15 Pardons. ARTICLE=> The White House announced President Donald Trump had granted 15 pardons and issued partial or full commutations for the prison sentences of five other individuals Tuesday. Those granted a pardon or clemency include three former GOP Reps who were convicted of various financial crimes and lying to the FBI; two people charged as part of the Russia investigation, including former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos; and three individuals convicted on drug and fraud-related charges. The news was covered more prominently by left- and center-rated outlets, which typically focused more on Papadopoulos and the Republican lawmakers than right-rated outlets did.
TITLE=> Biden Pledges to Evacuate All Americans and Afghan Allies from Kabul. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden pledged Friday to safely evacuate all American citizens and Afghan allies fleeing the Taliban. “Let me be clear, any American who wants to come home, we will get you home," Biden said. Biden also acknowledged that “this evacuation mission is dangerous,” adding, “I cannot promise what the final outcome will be, or… that it will be without risk of loss.” Responding to questions from reporters, Biden also said he had seen “no question of our credibility” from American allies and claimed that al Qaeda was “gone” from Afghanistan. However, Defense Department Press Secretary John Kirby later told reporters that al Qaeda and ISIS were “a presence” in the country and declined to provide exact figures.  Most coverage from across the spectrum focused on Biden’s commitment to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies. Some coverage in right-rated outlets focused on Kirby contradicting Biden’s al Qaeda claim. In quoting Biden’s “final outcome” statement, Fox News included Biden misspeaking, potentially contributing to a narrative in right-rated outlets that questions Biden’s mental fitness: “what the final outcome will be, or what it will be that it will be without risk of loss.” Other outlets tended to omit the misspoken words or replace them with an ellipsis. 
TITLE=> ’Fake News’ Award Winners are Revealed. ARTICLE=> President Trump revealed winners of his self-proclaimed "Fake News" awards on Twitter - and the New York Times topped the list.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Columbus Day 2020. ARTICLE=> Columbus Day, also recognized as Indigenous Peoples' Day in some parts of the United States, annually draws differing opinions on Christopher Columbus' legacy and his impact on Native American peoples and the overall development of the North American continent. Some left-rated voices explored possible connections between Columbus' journey in 1492 and religious bigotry. Some right-rated voices focused specifically on celebrating Columbus' legacy, framing critiques of him as attempts to unjustly rewrite history.
TITLE=> CDC Report Says Double Masking, Knotting and Tucking Reduce Coronavirus Spread. ARTICLE=> Wearing a close-fitting cloth mask over a surgical mask, also known as “double masking,” can significantly decrease transmission of COVID-19, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released Wednesday. The report also says that “knotting the ear loops of a medical procedure mask and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face” significantly reduces transmission. Furthermore, CDC studies show that exposure to the virus is reduced by up to 95% when both the source and the receiver use one or both of these techniques. Coverage followed similar narratives across the spectrum, but varied in the specific figures used to describe the CDC's findings. Some coverage also mentioned statements on double masking by Dr. Anthony Fauci and former President Donald Trump, although neither the left nor the right did this more than the other.
TITLE=> Trump Denies Reports That He Will Reinstate Family Separations, Blames Obama for Policy. ARTICLE=> President Trump denied reports that he planned to revive family separations at the border and renewed claims that former President Obama was responsible for the policy. Several fact-checkers have criticized that claim: Although previous administrations did have small numbers of family separations, they did not have a blanket rule requiring that all parents be prosecuted, and thus did not have to routinely remove them from their children.
TITLE=> Former FBI Lawyer Kevin Clinesmith to Plead Guilty in Falsifying Russia Probe Document. ARTICLE=> Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith will plead guilty to falsifying a document as part of a federal probe into the origins of an investigation into potential Russian collusion in the 2016 election, Clinesmith's attorney said on Friday. Clinesmith will plead guilty on one account of making a false statement. Clinesmith admitted to changing an email involved in the surveillance warrant for former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page; he changed the email to suggest that Page had not been a government source in the past. Clinesmith's expected plea comes after the FBI admitted in January that two of the four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants that authorized surveillance of Page were invalid. Some voices from right-rated outlets interpret Clinesmith's guilty plea as evidence that the FBI has a political agenda against Trump. Some voices from the left point out that Clinesmith's plea does not necessarily mean that there is more evidence of an orchestrated surveillance of Trump's 2016 campaign, citing a 2019 Justice Department report which found no "documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced" the opening of the counterintelligence probe.
TITLE=> Officials Uncertain on 2021 Goal for Border Wall Completion. ARTICLE=> Government officials are raising doubts regarding the completion of a new southern border wall by 2021; acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan expressed uncertainty about the goal in a recent interview with the New York Times. Building a complete, competent border wall is one of President Donald Trump's core campaign promises.
TITLE=> Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts Spar Over Independence of Judiciary. ARTICLE=> President Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts sparred over the independence of America's judiciary after Trump labeled the federal judge who blocked his migrant asylum executive order as an "Obama judge." Some argue that Roberts was right to stand up to Trump, as the president has consistently criticized judges who issue rulings he disagrees with. Others say that Roberts should not have voiced his opinion, insisting he should remain completely nonpolitical.
TITLE=> MGM Files Lawsuit Against Las Vegas Shooting Victims Claiming It Has "No Liability". ARTICLE=> MGM Resorts International, owner of the Las Vegas casino from where a gunman killed 58 and wounded hundreds, has filed a lawsuit against the victims of the Oct. 1 rampage claiming it has "no liability of any kind."
TITLE=> Social Media Summit Draws Wide Range of Coverage. ARTICLE=> The 'Social Media Summit' hosted by President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday made headlines throughout the country, prompting a wide variation of coverage and reactions. Most outlets covering the story acknowledged that Trump invited conservative website owners and pundits while excluding social media giants like Facebook and Twitter. Specific descriptions of the guests varied; some voices on the left labeled the group as "right-wing extremists" or "conservative activists", and some on the right called them "far-right firebrands" or "social media provocateurs." Some left-leaning outlets ran fact-checks on Trump's summit speeches, while others on the right focused coverage on some of the event's little-known guests. Outlets with center ratings focused on Trump's specific criticisms of big social media companies and recent Senate hearings regarding anti-conservative bias online.
TITLE=> Bipartisan Group Reaching Agreement On Key Police Reform Issues. ARTICLE=> A bipartisan group of lawmakers are working on legislative efforts to overhaul some police standards, and hope to present the bill by May 25, the one-year anniversary of George Floyd's death. The efforts would set federal standards for no-knock warrants, ban chokeholds except in life-threatening situations and place limits on equipment the Defense Department can send to state and local police departments. The bipartisan group, led by Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., along with Senators Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., are looking at reform issues that lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle can agree on. This comes after President Joe Biden has called on Congress to pass legislation ahead of the anniversary of Floyd's death.  Outlets from all sides of the spectrum tended to focus on the details of the legislation, and highlighted the key areas where Democrats and Republicans agree. Editor's Note, 5/10/21 at 5:01 pm: Our original summary incorrectly described Booker as a senator from New York. We've corrected this and regret the error.
TITLE=> Trade Deficit Hits Record High: Good News or Bad News?. ARTICLE=> The trade deficit hit a record high in 2018: Some say that shows the U.S. economy is expanding at a quicker rate than the rest of the world, while others argue President Trump and his increased tariffs are to blame.

TITLE=> President Trump Signs Bill Scrapping Auto-lending Measure Targeting Racial Bias. ARTICLE=> President Trump signed a bill nullifying an Obama-era rule put in place to protect consumers from racial discrimination when seeking loans to buy a car. Supporters of the repeal say that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) did not follow formal procedures to make the guidelines, as Obama did not submit it to Congress for review, and also note that Dodd-Frank law prevents the CFPB from regulating auto dealers. Detractors argue that it will allow these dealers to discriminate against minorities.
TITLE=> White House to Develop COVID-19 'Vaccine Passports'. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration is working with private companies to develop a proof-of-vaccination initiative, or a “vaccine passport” for Americans who have been inoculated against COVID-19. Several government agencies, including the offices of Health and Human Services, are coordinating with technology and travel companies, to develop the vaccine passport system, CNN reported Sunday. The vaccine passports could potentially be required for  travel, live entertainment and sporting events and dining out, as a growing number of businesses say they will require proof of vaccination before reopening. The passports are expected to be free and available through smartphone applications, which could display a scannable code; those without smartphone access should be able to print out the passports, according to developers. This comes as the European Union pledged to release digital certificates that would allow for travel by summer, and as a digital pass developed by IBM is being tested in New York. This story received coverage cross the political spectrum.
TITLE=> Clinton’s Fundraising Edge. ARTICLE=> Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her presidential bid with a resounding campaign cash advantage over Donald Trump.
TITLE=> US, Other Countries Race to Develop Coronavirus Vaccine. ARTICLE=> As coronavirus deaths in the U.S. and around the world continue to mount, scientists in various countries are racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Researchers in England have reported success with a vaccine being developed there, saying it could be made available to the public as early as September. Other countries, including Israel and the U.S., are also making progress. Coverage of the issue has focused on the efforts of those scientists and researchers, as well as coordination -- but also competition -- between countries on the global stage.
TITLE=> Six Charged in Plot to Kidnap Michigan Gov. Whitmer. ARTICLE=> Six people have been charged in federal court with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the FBI announced Thursday. The group allegedly plotted for several months to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home in retaliation to the governor's COVID-19 coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Separately, seven people were charged in Michigan state court for allegedly planning to attack law enforcement personnel and violently overthrow the state government. Coverage on all sides focused on Whitmer's apparent blaming of President Donald Trump for complicity in the plot against her; Whitmer said violent extremists took Trump's controversial comments about far-right groups at last week's debate "as a rallying cry. As a call to action." Some coverage from left-rated sources framed the president's past condemnation of Whitmer's purportedly oppressive lockdown measures as a motivating factor for the plans to kidnap her. Some reports from center- and right-rated outlets noted that there was no evidence either plot was directly inspired by Trump.
TITLE=> Perspectives: James Carville and the Language of 'Wokeness'. ARTICLE=> In an interview with Vox's Sean Illing published on April 27, Democratic strategist James Carville said the language of "wokeness" was a bad political strategy for Democrats. "We should talk about racial injustice. What I’m saying is, we need to do it without using jargon-y language that’s unrecognizable to most people — including most Black people, by the way — because it signals that you’re trying to talk around them," Carville said. Carville criticized "wokeness" again on Wednesday, blaming it for the success of a moderate Democrat over a progressive in a Louisiana congressional election. DNC chairman Jaime Harrison agreed with Carville on Friday, urging Democratic candidates to "speak plain English."  Perspectives on Carville's remarks were generally sparse and mostly published in left-rated outlets, with several right-rated outlets publishing news reports on the interview. Some voices from the right agreed with Carville's criticism of "woke" language, and some voices from the left were critical of Carville.
TITLE=> Attorneys at Chauvin Trial to Make Final Pitch. ARTICLE=> Attorneys in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd, are set to make their closing arguments Monday. After that, the jurors will start verdict deliberations. Chauvin faces three charges: unintentional murder in the second and third degree, and manslaughter in the second degree, and the jury will be considering intent. President Joe Biden is keeping a watchful eye on this week's closing arguments in the Minneapolis trial of Derek Chauvin, fearful that a controversial verdict could inflame new racial tensions and further escalate a deepening crisis in confidence with the nation's police forces. Many businesses throughout the city have boarded up their windows. Minneapolis schools are closed to in-person learning Wednesday through Friday in anticipation of the verdict.
TITLE=> Biden Prepares for Putin Meeting. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday at a time when the U.S. is accusing Russia of hacking federal agencies and interfering in the 2020 election.

TITLE=> Major Conservation Bill Passes Senate with Bipartisan Backing. ARTICLE=> A bill that would permanently appropriate $900 million in annual funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund passed through the Senate Wednesday by a 73-25 vote. A bipartisan Senate coalition of Democrat Joe Manchin (WV) and Republicans Cory Gardner (CO) and Steve Daines (MT) led the bill's development; Gardner and Manchin coauthored an op-ed about the bill for CNN's opinion section earlier this week. The legislation is titled the "Great Americans Outdoors Act." Right-rated outlets reported on the bill more frequently than left-rated sources, often concentrating on its bipartisan nature. Some coverage from left-rated sources reported that Gardner and Daines previously backed anti-conservation stances, framing their support for this bill as a move to attract voter support in an election year.
TITLE=> Biden To Require All Federal Employees To Get Vaccinated Or Undergo Regular Testing. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden announced a series of new protocols on Thursday in an attempt to get more Americans vaccinated and slow down the spread of COVID-19, including a new rule that requires all federal employees to be vaccinated or submit to a series of safety protocols. The president's new rule will apply to about 4 million people who work for the federal government, including contractors employed at federal sites. Similar steps are being taken by local governments and private institutions. Additionally, Biden called on state and local governments to give out $100 prizes to those who go out and get vaccinated. Left-rated outlets often highlighted how most COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across the country are linked to unvaccinated people. Right-rated sources were more likely to emphasize how federal employees are not required to get vaccinated and can choose to get tested regularly.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Enforces Travel Ban. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court has agreed to review President Donald Trump’s travel ban. It has also allowed the ban to take effect in most instances, with the exception of individuals with a bona fide relationship to the United States.

TITLE=> Perspectives: 'Viral' U.S. Army Ad Compared to Russian Army Ad. ARTICLE=> A U.S. Army ad went viral last weekend after a Twitter user compared it to a Russian army ad to show a difference in the tone and messaging. The Russian ad shows traditionally masculine men undergoing military fitness training, while the American ad is a colorful cartoon telling the story of how Cpl. Emma Malonelord decided to join the military. She says she was "raised by two moms” and “marched for equality.” The video shows her at her moms’ wedding and holding signs at a rally before she states that she graduated at the top of her class and found "a way to prove my inner strength" by joining the U.S. Army. After the tweet went viral, reactions were largely divided along the left and the right. Voices from the right pointed to the ad as a reflection of the "feminization of U.S. society," as well as a reflection of a purported shift in American ethos from "sacrificing...in the name of a higher good" to "glorifying" and "elevating" oneself. Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted, “Holy crap. Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea....”  Cruz received some criticism for purportedly implying that the Russian military was better than America's.

TITLE=> Trump Rebuked for Touting Conspiracy Theory on 'Fox & Friends'. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump is catching flak after pushing an apparent conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election during an interview yesterday on "Fox & Friends." Talking to the show's hosts, Trump claimed that the DNC gave its hacked server to a “Ukrainian company" and suggested that that was the basis of his concern about corruption in his phone call with the country's president. Both left and right-leaning media outlets noted that the theory has been debunked. Many pointed out that the company, named CrowdStrike, is actually headquartered in California and publicly traded on Nasdaq. Trump's call also came a day after former security official Fiona Hill, in the House's final public impeachment hearing, testified that the theory is “a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated ... by the Russian security services themselves.”

Both Todd and Cunningham have apologized for the scandal, but Cunningham has not said he would drop out of the race. On Fox News on Tuesday morning, Tillis called in demanding a full explanation from Cunningham. On Wednesday, Todd's husband, army veteran Jeremy Todd, called for Cunningham to drop out of the Senate race. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to frame both candidates' news as "scandals"; some left-rated outlets also highlighted the fact that Tillis was photographed with President Trump at Barrett's nomination.

TITLE=> Senate GOP Blocks January 6th Commission With Filibuster. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans on Friday blocked legislation to create an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6th storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump-supporting rioters. While the final procedural vote was 54-35 in favor, Republicans withheld enough votes to stop the bill’s supporters from getting over the 60 vote threshold required to overturn a filibuster. This was the first time Republicans used the filibuster this legislative session, as support grows among Democrats for reforming or abolishing the practice. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine), Bill Cassidy (La.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) voted in favor. Eleven senators missed the vote, including Democrats Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Patty Murray (Wash.).

On Friday, Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson sent a letter to the Justice Department inspector general asking him to investigate the recently released documents. The records said the erasures were due to forgotten passwords, hardware issues and damage to the phones. Johnson's letter also asks when the DOJ was made aware of the issue and if the information from the phones can be retrieved. On Saturday, President Donald Trump called Mueller's team a "hit squad" on Twitter. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the reports; some highlighted the history of some members of Mueller's team.

TITLE=> S. Africa COVID-19 Variant Detected In US; Vaccine Manufacturers Test Effectiveness Against It. ARTICLE=> The COVID-19 variant B.1351, first identified in South Africa, has been confirmed for the first time in the United States as vaccine developers test their drug's effectiveness against the new variant. The Svariant has raised concerns over being more contagious than other strains of the virus, and for potentially evading the immunity provided by antibodies. According to a release from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control on Thursday, two cases have been reported in the state, though there is no known travel history or connection between the cases. The World Health Organization reports that the variant has been reported in 31 countries. Vaccine manufacturers  Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech said their vaccine would still prevent the new strain, though its effects were weaker against it. Moderna is currently working on a "booster" against the new virus. On Thursday, Novavax Inc. said its U.K. trial is 89.3% effective in preventing COVID-19, but was just less than 50% effective in preventing the South Africa variant. This story received wide coverage across the political spectrum.

Others focused on Trump's unusually graphic description of the raid, during which he said the ISIS leader died "whimpering and screaming."
TITLE=> HHS Secretary Becerra Says Comments About "Government's Business" and Vaccination Status Were Taken Out of Context. ARTICLE=> Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra sparked controversy on Thursday after an interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. Keilar asked, “I wonder if you can answer that criticism: ‘It’s none of the government’s business knowing who has or hasn’t been vaccinated.’ What do you say?” Becerra responded, “It is absolutely the government’s business, it is taxpayers’ business, if we have to continue to spend money to try to keep people from contracting covid and helping reopen the economy.” Becerra later tweeted that his comments were “taken wildly out of context” and that the “government has no database tracking who is vaccinated.” Coverage was more prominent in right-rated outlets, with Fox News featuring the story at the top of its homepage. Coverage in several outlets across the spectrum took Becerra’s comments to mean that it was the government’s business to know who had been vaccinated.

TITLE=> Trump Administration Executes Brandon Bernard in Record-Setting String of Executions. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration is set to execute a record 13 federal prisoners by the end of President Donald Trump’s term. On Thursday, Brandon Bernard was executed for his involvement in the 1999 murder of two youth ministers. Bernard, 40, was the youngest federal prisoner to be executed in 70 years, and his case sparked a wave of activism against the death penalty that garnered high-profile support. The Supreme Court denied Bernard’s request for a stay of execution despite the support of the Court’s three liberal justices. Prior to the Justice Department’s July decision to resume executions, only three federal executions had taken place in the previous four decades. Four more federal executions are scheduled to take place before Trump leaves office in January, including one on Friday. Coverage across the spectrum was split between coverage of Bernard’s case, celebrity activism, Bernard’s execution, and executions generally. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets was more likely to report the overall number of executions carried out under the Trump administration.
TITLE=> US Gymnasts Criticize FBI's Investigation of Larry Nassar at Senate Hearing. ARTICLE=> Four top U.S. gymnasts testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday about the FBI’s investigation of former national team doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving the equivalent of a life sentence for multiple sex crimes. Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols called for accountability and said that FBI agents had falsified statements, delayed interviews after complaints, failed to properly report and investigate sexual assault allegations, failed to properly document evidence, and knowingly allowed Nassar to continue abusing minors. The gymnasts often cited a Justice Department OIG report from July on the FBI’s investigation. Days before the hearing, the FBI fired the agent involved in Maroney’s case. FBI Director Christopher Wray also testified at the hearing and apologized for the FBI’s “inexcusable” mishandling of the investigation.  Most outlets across the spectrum prominently featured this story on Wednesday evening. Coverage was broadly balanced and supportive of the gymnasts regardless of the outlet’s bias rating. Coverage tended to focus primarily on one of the gymnasts, usually Simone Biles. Sensationalist language was also common, including “scathing,” “explosive” and “gut-wrenching.”

TITLE=> Democrats Tie Debt Ceiling Suspension to Spending Bill to Avoid Shutdown. ARTICLE=> Congressional Democrats announced Monday that they would attach a suspension of the debt ceiling to an upcoming stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown. In a Sunday Wall Street Journal op-ed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated her warning that if Congress did not raise or suspend the debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its financial obligations later this year and cause significant damage to the global economy. Despite that warning, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday reiterated his pledge that no Republican would vote for a debt ceiling bill, effectively forcing Democrats to pass the bill on their own. Democrats’ proposed bill would suspend the debt ceiling until December 2022, shortly after the next midterm elections; the ceiling was previously suspended in 2019 until July 2021.  Coverage was most prominent in business- and politics-focused outlets. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to be less alarmist in describing the danger of a default; while The New York Times said it could be "financially catastrophic" and CNBC said it "could devastate the global economy," Fox Business said it "could have serious and negative economic implications," and neither the Washington Examiner nor the New York Post addressed such potential consequences outside of quotes from Yellen and Democratic leaders.

TITLE=> Lawmakers Disagree on Stimulus Changes; Vote Slated for Monday. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, Congressional Democrats and Republicans blocked each other's requested changes to the recent $900 billion stimulus proposal. Democrats sought to increase the planned stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 in agreement with a request from President Donald Trump, but GOP lawmakers blocked the request. Democrats then rejected Republican efforts to revisit foreign aid allocations in the bill, an attempt that appeased another request from Trump. The House will hold a recorded vote Monday to address the proposed stimulus check increase, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Without Trump's signature on the stimulus bill, millions of unemployed Americans will lose benefits Saturday when jobless benefit programs established earlier in the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic expire. Government funds will run out this weekend unless Congress passes another stopgap funding measure by Monday. Coverage from some left-rated outlets framed Republican lawmakers as disagreeable; reports from some right-rated sources painted Democrats in a similarly negative light. Many reports on both sides focused on unemployed Americans who may lose federal aid this weekend; some also framed the possible government shutdown in the context of federal coronavirus vaccine distribution efforts.
TITLE=> Tucker Carlson Says NSA Spied On Him, NSA Denies Claim. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the National Security Agency (NSA) denied Fox News host Tucker Carlson's claims that the agency is spying on him. Carlson said on his show Monday that a an anonymous U.S. government official warned Carlson that the NSA is "monitoring Carlson's electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take [the] show off the air." Carlson said he was convinced because the anonymous official apparently had information about a story "that could have only come directly from my texts and emails." The NSA posted tweet Tuesday denying Carlson's allegations, saying that the NSA is not allowed to target an individual without a court order that explicitly authorizes targeting. When asked about Carlson's claims in a press conference, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the NSA "focuses on foreign threats and individuals who are attempting to do us harm on foreign soil." After the NSA posted the statement, Carlson called it "an entire paragraph of lies." on his show Tuesday.  Some right-rated outlets focused on the details of Carlson's claims. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to frame Carlson's claim as false; some left-rated outlets also highlighted other unsubstantiated claims Carlson has made previously. 
TITLE=> Port of LA, Major Shipping Companies Switch to 24/7 Operations Amid Supply Chain Issues. ARTICLE=> In a speech Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced the Port of Los Angeles will move to 24/7 service in order to process long backlogs of incoming cargo. The Port of L.A. joins the Port of Long Beach in switching to a 24/7 schedule; those two ports handle roughly 40% of incoming container traffic to the U.S. Global supply chains have struggled to keep up with a surge in demand for goods as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden said the move will boost the time spent unloading container ships by 60 hours a week. UPS, FedEx and Walmart have also reportedly committed to 24/7 work hours to help remedy the supply chain crunch. Outlets on all sides covered the announcement prominently Wednesday, with many framing the supply chain issues in the context of COVID-19 and the upcoming holiday season. Many across the spectrum also highlighted a Labor Department report that said nearly 3% of the U.S. workforce quit their jobs in September. Some coverage from right-rated outlets painted the overall economic situation as more dire by describing inflation and federal spending concerns alongside the supply chain news. Headlines from the right were also more likely to mention the operation's 24/7 nature. Some reports from left-rated outlets framed the general supply chain issue as indicative of major flaws with global shipping systems.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Raising the Minimum Wage. ARTICLE=> In his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief aid proposal, President Joe Biden included a plan to increase minimum wage to $15 per hour. The plan would more than double the national minimum wage in increments over four years from $7.25 per hour, where it has stood since 2009. Advocates of the plan highlight how a $15 minimum wage would help full-time workers rise above the poverty line; others point out how it could help those affected by wage gaps. Some experts warn it could lead to higher unemployment rates as the country struggles to recover from pandemic layoffs. The proposal also has the support of some labor unions. Some large businesses, who have raised their own wages in past years, support a higher federal minimum to level the playing field. Some who oppose the bill argue that $15 per hour is too high for areas with a lower cost of living, and that a higher minimum could cause small businesses to layoff workers or cut hours, leading to higher unemployment rates. Outlets from across the spectrum analyzed the potential impacts of raising the minimum wage. Voices from the left examined how a raise could even the playing field for those under the poverty line. Voices from the right tended to point out the negative effect the raise could have on small businesses and the economy in the long term; some also argued that a minimum wage raise can't be passed through the Senate via budget reconciliation.

TITLE=> Biden to Propose $6 Trillion Federal Budget for 2022. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden is preparing to propose a $6 trillion federal government budget for fiscal year 2022, The New York Times reported Thursday. According to a CNBC source, this would amount to $5 trillion in additional federal spending over the next decade.

The plan also calls for raising annual federal spending to $8.2 trillion by 2031. Furthermore, Biden’s plan would keep annual deficits above $1.3 trillion over the next decade, with the federal government spending more as a percentage of the economy than any year since World War II, except 2020 and 2021.  Most coverage from across the spectrum focused on the New York Times report and included its framing around total annual spending and WWII. Some left- and center-rated outlets focused on other reported aspects of the budget, including CNBC’s “$5 trillion increase” framing, increased military cyber force spending, and comments by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

The package proposes social welfare investments over a decade, in addition to $800 billion in tax benefits, which Biden will say can be paid for over 15 years. While Democrats may be pleased with much of the plan's contents, its price tag may raise some concern.  Republicans are already opposed to the cost of Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure package. Biden will make his case before a pared-down gathering of mask-wearing legislators due to coronavirus restrictions.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Thanksgiving History and the American People. ARTICLE=> Facing a tense political climate and COVID-19 coronavirus restrictions, the 2020 Thanksgiving holiday has a bit of a different feel. Projected presidential election winner Joe Biden delivered a holiday address Wednesday, as debate continues about how to celebrate the holiday safely and joyously. Another point of discussion is how Thanksgiving connects with American history and its Indigenous peoples. Some voices from the right explored the history of Thanksgiving, celebrating the attempts at peacemaking between European settlers and Native Americans; these voices also criticized attempts to cast the traditional Thanksgiving story as a masking of the settlers' abuse of Indigenous peoples. Some Indigenous voices featured in left-rated outlets expressed concern that the holiday celebrations glaze over the oppression and violence Native Americans have faced in the past 400 years.
TITLE=> US Job Openings Hit Record High, Layoffs to Record Low. ARTICLE=> Job openings in the U.S. hit a record 9.2 million at the end of May, the U.S. Labor Department said Wednesday. These numbers are a slight increase from the previous month's 9.19 million; however, industries such as hotels and restaurants saw a rise in jobs openings as a record 4 million people quit their jobs in April, and 3.6 million people quit in May. Layoffs also hit a record low in May, indicating a tight market for employers. May's job openings numbers are about 30% higher than the numbers were just before the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020.  The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Some outlets highlighted quotes from employers struggling to staff their businesses.

TITLE=> Cuomo Defends Pandemic Response, Says Pausing Nursing Home Death Numbers Was a Mistake. ARTICLE=> New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Monday defended his administration’s COVID-19 response and acknowledged that the lack of transparency regarding COVID-19 related deaths in nursing homes in New York was a mistake. Cuomo said the state Health Department “paused” state lawmakers’ inquiry into nursing home death data to focus on addressing the general pandemic and the Justice Department's request for similar information in August; Cuomo also said that both chambers of state legislature were informed of the decision. This comes after Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa told state legislators the administration “froze” releasing information about nursing home deaths out of concern the DOJ would launch a federal investigation. New York Attorney General Letitia James also accused the Cuomo administration of severely undercounting those deaths connected to nursing homes. In late January, the state had reported 8,500 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, leaving out those who died outside of the facilities, such as after being transferred to a hospital. A more accurate number, according to James' probe, would be more than 13,000 COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. The story received wide coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Voices from the left and center criticized Cuomo's handling of the pandemic; some voices from the right also accused the media of enabling Cuomo's cover-up.
TITLE=> California Recall Election for Gov. Gavin Newsom Draws Near. ARTICLE=> California's upcoming special election on whether to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is set for Sept. 14. Every California voter has been sent a ballot at their address for the option to vote by mail, or on election day. More than 50% of voters must vote "yes" to the recall for Newsom to be removed. The recall effort stems largely from Californians' frustrations with Newsom's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and purportedly overbearing public health edicts. Forty-six candidates signed up to run against Newsom; in April, the petition to recall him reached over 1.7 million signatures, meeting the threshold needed to schedule a recall election. Many sources across the spectrum say conservative talk show host Larry Elder is the frontrunning challenger. 	Coverage in California and around the country has covered the recall effort, Newsom's challengers, and the chances of him being voted out. Some left-rated sources highlighted data on early voting that shows a lead for Newsom; some on the right highlighted how Elder and others are moving to win over groups from whom Newsom needs more support, such as Latinos and young people. Sources across the spectrum have also concentrated Newsom's cash advantage; some on the left say that advantage might not matter, and some on the right focused on prominent Newsom donors, such as billionaire George Soros.
TITLE=> Trump Will "Strongly Consider" Testifying In Impeachment Inquiry. ARTICLE=> In a Monday morning tweet, President Trump said that he will "strongly consider" testifying in the impeachment inquiry over his dealings with Ukraine.

TITLE=> Robert Mueller to Testify Publicly Next Month Before Congress. ARTICLE=> Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will testify before two House committees next month in a public session about his investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Mueller has spoken publicly only once about his work as special counsel. In May, Mueller said he could neither clear nor accuse Trump of obstructing justice. Democrats consider Mueller's public testimony to be crucial to their goal of building public support for impeachment. By the time Mueller testifies, the Justice Department inspector general may have released his report on the FBI’s use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) system in the early stages of the Russia probe, potentially bolstering Republican claims that FBI abuses occurred as part of that process.
TITLE=> Biden Reaches 100 Days In Office. ARTICLE=> This week, President Joe Biden reaches 100 days in office, a milestone often used to measure presidents' progress during the early part of their term. Since taking office, Biden has signed 11 bills into law and issued 42 executive orders — the most in a president's first 100 days since Roosevelt in 1933. Biden also reversed 62 Trump-era orders, which include re-joining the Paris climate agreement, pausing the U.S. exit from the World Health Organization and pausing border wall construction. Most news outlets focused on analyzing Biden's response to individual issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, immigration, climate change and healthcare, as well as his bipartisan endeavors.  Outlets from across the spectrum said Biden has yet to make much progress toward his goal of restoring bipartisanship and unity; many cited Biden's American Rescue Plan, which passed without a single GOP vote, as evidence of this. Outlets on the left and center compared Biden's 53% approval rating 100 days into office, comparing it to that of Trump's. Some voices from the right claim Biden's high number of executive orders is proof Biden intends to push the left's agenda and is not really after bipartisanship.
TITLE=> Justice Pursues Those Involved in Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> In comments that have since been walked back, federal prosecutors wrote in court this week that those who breached the U.S. Capitol building intended to "capture and assassinate elected officials in the United States government." Those involved are now facing criminal consequences, as the FBI has opened more than 170 case files and arrested at least 70 people in connection with the breach. Many reports, especially from left- and center-rated sources, concentrated on ongoing federal probes of and intent behind the breach. Some highlighted reports that those who broke into the building allegedly included highly-trained ex-military and members of law enforcement, connecting those claims to larger concerns about right-wing extremism within police departments and military outfits. Some coverage from right-rated sources focused on John Sullivan, a left-wing activist arrested for his alleged role in the breach.
TITLE=> 10 Killed in Mass Shooting At Colorado Market. ARTICLE=> A gunman armed with a rifle killed at least 10 people including a police officer at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado on Monday. Dozens of armored vehicles, ambulances and armed personnel were deployed to the scene, and an injured suspect was taken into custody. The incident follows another mass shooting last week in Georgia that left eight dead. President Joe Biden made no mention of gun control in the aftermath of that shooting, but there is speculation that he'll face more pressure to voice an opinion on the matter following the Colorado shooting.
TITLE=> How the Public Views Reparations for Slavery. ARTICLE=> Conversations about paying reparations for slavery, along with fresh polling data on the subject, have recently come to the forefront. Some conversations center on whether reparations to descendants of slaves are owed or not; others revolve around the exact policies needed to further racial equality, including educational and financial reparations.

Some left-rated outlets painted the poll results as 'growing calls' for reparations.

TITLE=> Nikki Haley's Comments On Confederate Flag Spotlight Media Bias. ARTICLE=> In an interview with The Blaze's Glenn Beck on Friday, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley discussed the 2015 massacre by Dylan Roof of nine members of an African American church in Charleston, South Carolina. Then a governor of the state, Haley said the flag had represented "service, sacrifice, and heritage" for residents there until Roof, an avowed white supremacist, "hijacked" its meaning. Ensuing coverage of the interview served as a case study in media bias, as some outlets seemed to take Haley's comments out of context, implying that she herself believed the flag represented service and sacrifice. Others failed to add that as governor at the time of the shooting, Haley had called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds -- a decision she said on Sunday she still stands by.
TITLE=> More on London Attack. ARTICLE=> The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its Aamaq News Agency and called the assailant, who was shot dead by police, a "soldier of the Islamic State." The claim couldn't immediately be verified.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he hopes the package will pass in mid-September. Meanwhile, the final details will be negotiated by a dozen Senate committees, with some Democrats wary of the price tag. Outlets on the left were more likely to praise Biden for his "expansive" vision.
TITLE=> Misleading Reports on Trump's Mention of George Floyd at Press Conference. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said "today is a great day" for George Floyd at a press conference Friday, where he discussed the state of equality in the U.S. and the most recent information on the nation's economy. Many left- and center-rated outlets framed the comments as if Trump was saying Floyd would be pleased with the surprisingly good May jobs report. Conversely, right-rated outlets fact checked those reports from left-rated outlets, showing that Trump was apparently instead suggesting Floyd would be pleased with the recent demonstrations advocating for equal justice and "fair treatment from law enforcement." Voices on all sides painted the president's mention of Floyd as insensitive. As of Saturday afternoon, many misleading stories on the press conference had not been updated. Updated 6/6/20 at 7:19pm ET

Notable outlets not called upon by Biden included Fox News (Lean Right) and The New York Times (Lean Left). Voices from across the spectrum had a wide variety of perspectives on the press conference. Voices in right-rated outlets were strongly critical of Biden and the press, arguing that Biden made false statements, that he “torched” his message of unity, and that the press gave him “softball” questions. Voices in left-rated outlets were mixed, mostly viewing Biden’s performance favorably but with some criticizing the press for failing to ask adequate questions about issues like the COVID-19 pandemic.
TITLE=> China Imposes another $60 Billion in Tariffs. ARTICLE=> In response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, China announced today that they will be imposing another $60 billion in new trade tariffs on US goods.
TITLE=> Biden, Trump React to Capitol Hill Breach. ARTICLE=> President-elect Joe Biden, President Donald Trump and other lawmakers addressed the breach of the Capitol building Wednesday. From a Delaware theater Wednesday afternoon, Biden called on the "mob to pull back and allow democracy to go forward," adding that there was "an assault on the rule of law" that “borders on sedition.” Biden also called for Trump to go on national television "to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege.” Shortly after, Trump released a video calling for "peace" and urging non-violence while repeating his claims that the election was stolen from him. The president told his supporters, "I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.” Trump's video has since been removed from social media platforms Twitter, Facebook and YouTube; Twitter and Facebook said they removed the video for its potential to contribute to ongoing violence, while YouTube cited a policy against content that make unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud or errors. Trump's accounts have been locked for 24 hours by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Lawmakers on both sides, including Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the violence as they reconvened at the secured Capitol building Wednesday night to resume the electoral vote count. Biden's call for protesters to pull back was covered across the political spectrum. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight Trump's urge for peace; left-rated outlets tended to focus on his repeated claims of election fraud. Social media platforms' removal of Trump's video was covered across the spectrum as well.
TITLE=> Senator McConnell Will Move To Acquit President Trump, Not Dismiss Charges. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is expected to hold a final vote to acquit President Trump, should he be impeached, when a majority of senators believe his trial has run its course instead of holding a vote on dismissing the articles of impeachment. Acquittal, rather than a dismissal, would clear President Trump of the charges that are expected to be approved by the House of Representatives.
TITLE=> Georgia Secretary of State's Office to Launch Probe Into Trump's Election Phone Calls. ARTICLE=> The Georgia Secretary of State's office is reportedly launching a "fact-finding and administrative" investigation into former President Donald Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn election results in the state, Reuters reported Monday. One of those efforts includes a phone call from Trump to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, in which Trump said he wanted to "find" 11,780 more votes to change the outcome of the election in Georgia. On the call, Raffensperger defended the state's voting system and the results of the election. CNN reported that a Georgia prosecutor's office is weighing whether to pursue criminal charges of election fraud against Trump. The story received coverage across the political spectrum. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the allegations of voter fraud Trump made during the Jan. 2 phone call; left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the details of the investigation other potential charges as a result of the phone call.

Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has supposedly been working on this deal for roughly three years, with support from both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition candidate Benny Gantz. Palestinian leaders were not consulted during the plan's formation, and have formally rejected it. Some left-rated outlets framed the plan as "controversial" and unlikely to succeed, while right-rated media generally painted the plan in a more optimistic light.
TITLE=> Explosion Rocks Lebanese Capital, Killing Dozens. ARTICLE=> A massive explosion in Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, killed dozens and injured thousands Tuesday. Initial reports from Lebanese officials suggest the blast was caused by a warehouse fire; the warehouse was reportedly home to highly explosive materials. Reporting throughout the spectrum was largely uniform, often deferring to statements from Lebanese leaders and health officials. However, some reports framed official statements from Lebanese leaders as fact, while other coverage conveyed more skepticism about the blast's cause. Others also focused on initial speculation that Israel was responsible for the explosion; Israeli officials denied this, and verbally offered to aid the recovery effort.
TITLE=> 11-Year Bull Market Ends as Volatility, Coronavirus Fears Plague Wall Street. ARTICLE=> Wall Street's all-time longest "bull market" run — 11 years — ended Wednesday as U.S. stocks continue to feel dramatic effects from global coronavirus panic.

TITLE=> Public Impeachment Hearings to Commence Next Week. ARTICLE=> House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) announced that public hearings on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump will start next week. Schiff announced the hearings via Twitter;  it will mark the first time that the public will hear lawmakers discuss evidence of Trump's ties to a scandal involving Ukraine and a privately-pushed investigation of the Bidens.

TITLE=> Taliban Use Violence in Response to Protests and Dissent. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, reports surfaced across the political spectrum of the Taliban using violence to break up protests and consolidate control over Afghanistan.  The Taliban's promise of "safe passage" for Afghans to the Kabul airport has also been contradicted by photographs and media reports as thousands attempt to escape the country. These reports conflict with the Taliban's recent assurances that they would not hold grudges against past enemies, infringe on women's rights, and that they would welcome free press.
TITLE=> Concerns with "Serious Errors" by FBI in Warrants to Spy. ARTICLE=> "Basic, fundamental and serious errors" by the FBI, especially in getting a warrant from the FISA court to "spy" on American citizens, has raised serious concerns about civil liberties from the left, center and right. Information presented to the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court was described by Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz as misleading with 17 examples of “significant inaccuracies and omissions” including one case when a lawyer with the FBI altered an email to help persuade the court to approve a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign aide. While many groups from the left that normally would be outraged by infringements on civil liberties by national security authorities remained relatively silent, presumably because criticism would politically benefit President Trump, others like the ACLU called for reform. Many on the right were not only outraged by these actions against civil liberties, but also how the FBI under the Obama Administration used misleading and altered evidence to obtain permission to spy on a political rival's campaign. They felt that even if the Inspector General could not find direct evidence to prove bias, the underlying bias was self evident and their actions were corrupt.
TITLE=> Biden to Debate Trump Despite Pelosi's Calls to Cancel. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden said Thursday he won't skip the upcoming presidential debates with President Donald Trump after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters earlier that day she thought the debates should be canceled. Pelosi cited Trump's 2016 presidential debates, and said that she did not think Trump had "comported himself in a way that has any association with truth, evidence, data and facts." Shortly after, Biden confirmed in an interview with MSNBC that he would debate Trump, saying he would use the debates as an opportunity to be a “fact checker on the floor." Pelosi later told MSNBC later Thursday that her comments have nothing to do with Biden, and that Biden is "a great debater." Some voices from the right framed Pelosi's comments as evidence that the left has little faith in Biden's ability to successfully debate Trump; many voices from the right think that the debates can give Trump an advantage in the election. Left-rated outlets focused more on Pelosi saying that she thought the debates as a whole should be canceled, and on Biden's comments.

TITLE=> New Florida Law Seeks to Regulate Speech Moderation on Social Media. ARTICLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed a law Monday aimed at regulating how social media companies moderate speech on their platforms. The law will fine social media platforms if they permanently ban political candidates in Florida; allow people to sue those companies if they feel they've been unfairly deplatformed; and prevent companies from removing content from news outlets above a certain size. DeSantis said the law will ensure Floridians "are guaranteed protection against the Silicon Valley elites." Some First Amendment experts say the law is likely to be challenged on the premise that it would compel speech from private companies, in violation of their First Amendment rights. 	Coverage was present across the political spectrum, but more prominent from right-rated outlets. Reports from left- and center-rated sources highlighted the law's objectives, as well as concerns about its constitutionality. Coverage from right-rated sources tended to concentrate more on the legislation's language and support for it.

Biden also remembered his late son Beau Biden, who served in the Iraq War and died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015. "It's also an important tradition in our family. As many of you know, this is a hard day for us. Six years ago today … I lost my son," Biden said. "So thank you for allowing us to grieve together today." Biden also took a stand for human rights on Sunday, saying he had a two-hour conversation recently with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and made "it clear to him we could do nothing but speak out for human rights around the world because that's who we are," Biden said, adding, "I'll be meeting with [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin in a couple weeks in Geneva making it clear that we will not stand by and let him abuse those rights." The Biden administration has condemned Beijing’s treatment of China’s Uyghur population, likening it to genocide.  Coverage from left and center-rated outlets tended to focus on Biden's warning to leaders of China and Russia, as well as details of the U.S.' dealings with the respective countries. Coverage from some right-rated outlets tended to highlight Biden's remarks remembering fallen troops, as well as his son. 
TITLE=> NC to Repeal Bathroom Bill. ARTICLE=> North Carolina lawmakers announced late last night a proposed repeal of the controversial law that has cost the state jobs and millions of dollars.

TITLE=> Fact Check: Is The White House Working With SMS Carriers to Curb Vaccine Misinformation?. ARTICLE=> The White House and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) dispelled rumors that they are working with cell phone carriers to monitor and fact-check private text messages, after a Politico article Monday said the Biden administration and the DNC were "planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages." White House and DNC officials reportedly told the Washington Examiner Wednesday that the speculation is false. One of the authors of the Politico article, Natasha Korecki, tweeted clarification, saying, "it’s allied, private groups that are working with SMS carriers – not the White House", and that the groups do not have the ability to read individual texts "aside from the ones they receive themselves." The rumor comes as the White House turns to a more focused approach to vaccinate all Americans against COVID-19 amid the spread of the Delta variant. Some outlets on the left, including Politico, highlighted conservative groups who criticized the Biden administration's door-to-door vaccine efforts, and framed those groups as "fearmongers" spreading disinformation. Some right-rated outlets highlighted other ways political officials from both parties monitor mass text messages from the other side.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's Attempt to Bring 'Healing' to Kenosha. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden visited Kenosha, Wisconsin on Thursday, two days after his opponent President Donald Trump paid a visit to the battleground state. While Trump's visit to buildings damaged by riots highlighted his "law and order" message, Biden framed his visit as an attempt to bring "healing" to the city. Biden held a community meeting at Grace Lutheran Church, where he and community leaders discussed topics including criminal justice reform, systemic racism and education. Later that day, Biden visited the family of Jacob Blake, whose Aug. 23 shooting by police led to a wave of protests and violence in the city. Biden in Kenosha reiterated his push for racial justice and his condemnation of violence while criticizing Trump for his "divisive" rhetoric. Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to highlight Biden's visit to the Blake family, his community meeting, and his rhetoric of "peace" and "unity," while contrasting it with Trump's push for strong law enforcement. Some center-rated outlets said Biden's message of support for racial justice and condemnation of violence would require a challenging balancing act. Voices from the right tended to highlight Biden's questionable word choice during the community meeting, as well as those who were skeptical of Biden's visit to Kenosha.

ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at expanding access to economic and educational opportunities for the Latino community.

Reports from right-rated outlets focused specifically on the details of the Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, a big part of which is expanding school choice for Hispanic students. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources focused instead on Unanue's comments, and the apparent social media backlash that followed; several calls to boycott Goya Foods trended on Twitter in the U.S. Thursday.

The bill passed 252 -175, with 35 Republicans joining all Democrats in support. The bill was authored by Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and New York Republican Rep. John Katko, the top lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee, who said in a joint statement that, "there has been a growing consensus that the January 6th attack is of a complexity and national significance that what we need [is] an independent commission to investigate." The bill faces opposition from several GOP leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McConnell said Wednesday that he opposes the legislation because it is a “slanted and unbalanced proposal.” Former President Donald Trump released a statement Tuesday evening describing the bill as a “Democrat trap," and urging McConnell and other GOP leaders to start “listening.”   Coverage from across the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the bill, highlight Republican opposition, and provides peculation as to the bill's likelihood of passing.
TITLE=> NRA Files for Bankruptcy, Plans to Move from New York to Texas. ARTICLE=> The National Rifle Association (NRA) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week. The gun rights group plans to reincorporate in Texas; it's currently based in New York, where state Attorney General Letitia James has sued the group for allegedly using $64 million in funds improperly. The NRA responded by accusing James of targeting it for partisan reasons and violating its free speech rights as a nonprofit. Coverage from left-rated sources focused more on the lawsuits against the NRA. Reports from right-rated outlets focused more on the NRA's reasons for relocating and its criticisms of New York's government.

TITLE=> California Gov. Newsom Defeats Recall Effort. ARTICLE=> A majority of Californians voted against the effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), ending the lengthy campaign to oust him over what critics argued were overly restrictive COVID-19 guidelines. According to an Associated Press projection and other news sources across the spectrum, 64% of people had voted "no" to recalling Newsom with roughly 68% of ballots counted as of Wednesday morning. Conservative talk show host Larry Elder was the favorite to replace Newsom if a majority of people had voted "yes." Newsom tweeted, "Now, let’s get back to work" late Tuesday; Elder conceded Tuesday night, telling his supporters to "be gracious in defeat." Coverage from left-rated outlets often framed Newsom's victory as a win for Democrats, a rebuke of traditional conservatism, and a vote for more restrictive pandemic guidelines. Coverage from right-rated sources more often reflected on the original reasons for the recall, and placed more focus on Elder's campaign and political future.

It's Harris's first trip to the border since President Joe Biden tasked her in late March with exploring the root causes of immigration to the U.S. from Central America. Harris has faced intense criticism, both from Republicans and progressive Democrats, for her purportedly lackadaisical handling of the assignment so far. The number of immigrants arriving at the border is at its highest point in over two decades. Coverage across the spectrum highlighted the news. Some reports from right-rated sources focused on Harris's seemingly defensive answers to reporters in El Paso on Friday; others highlighted her apparent blame of the Trump administration for the current situation at the southern border. Coverage from left-rated sources focused more on Harris's objectives for her Friday trip, and on her responses to criticism.

TITLE=> Trump Tells Congresswomen to 'Go Back' to the Countries They Came From. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump prompted backlash after he tweeted that progressive Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to countries they came from and fix problems there, "then come back and show us how it is done" instead of "loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States ... how our government is to be run." Commentators on both the left and right condemned the comments, with many calling the comments racist.
TITLE=> Sessions Vows to Fight Bias at DOJ. ARTICLE=> In a speech on Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said his mission for the Justice Department was to enforce the law and that "it means absolutely eliminating political bias or favoritism – in either direction – from our investigations and prosecutions."

ARTICLE=> American Olympic gymnast Simone Biles withdrew from the women’s team final on Tuesday, citing concern for her mental health after she felt “the weight of the world” on her shoulders and lost herself mid-air during the competition. The U.S. team went on to win silver in the women’s team final, and Biles also withdrew from Thursday’s all-around competition. Biles’ decision garnered particularly polarized reactions: most left-leaning and non-partisan commentators supported Biles; some right-leaning commentators criticized her. USA Gymnastics responded supportively, saying, “We wholeheartedly support Simone’s decision and applaud her bravery in prioritizing her well-being.” Meanwhile, TPUSA founder and right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk called Biles “weak,” a “shame to the country” and a “selfish sociopath” in a viral video. Biles' next event is scheduled for Sunday. Voices in left-rated outlets were broadly supportive of Biles and increased attention on mental health, with some commentators calling her “the GOAT” (Greatest of All Time). Voices in right-rated outlets were mixed, with some voices supporting Biles and others criticizing her and her supporters for purportedly endorsing individualism instead of a team-first mentality. Some left-rated outlets also published coverage of right-wing criticism, calling it “unhinged.”
TITLE=> Infrastructure Talks Continue, Clock Ticks On Bipartisan Deal. ARTICLE=> Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Sunday that while the White House will continue to press for a bipartisan infrastructure deal, the Democratic-controlled House will begin to take next steps by marking up the current version of the package on Wednesday. “This has got to be done soon," Granholm told CNN. "The thing is, it’s just a bit perplexing why the Republicans haven’t moved further on critical pieces." This comes after Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) offered to add $50 billion to the GOP's $928 billion counteroffer on Friday. Biden offered to lower his initial $2.3 trillion proposal to $1 trillion Thursday, though it would still be funded by a corporate tax hike with a 15% tax floor. Republicans firmly oppose the tax hike, instead proposing that their bill be funded in part by leftover funds originally set aside for COVID-19 relief. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) told Fox News Sunday that he is still “very, very confident” a bipartisan deal can be reached. Some coverage from the left highlighted Granholm's criticism of Republicans. Center and right outlets tended to focus on the history and details of infrastructure negotiations.

TITLE=> Russia Offered Afghan Militants Bounties to Kill U.S. Soldiers. ARTICLE=> United States intelligence confirmed that a Russian spy unit offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants in exchange for the targeting of U.S. troops, as the New York Times first reported Friday. Though 20 Americans were killed in Afghanistan last year, it is unclear which killings are possibly linked to the bounties. Russia has denied the report. President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the intelligence with national security officials in late March, a detail the White House denies; the administration has not yet authorized a response. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum mentioned the fact that Trump has sought a peace deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. When it comes to wording, left- and center-rated sources used the words "Afghan militants" in their headlines, while some right-rated sources used the word "Taliban" in their headlines. Some left-rated outlets also highlighted Trump's past inclination to take an accommodating stance toward Russia. Updated 6/28/2020 at 7:15 a.m. ET
TITLE=> Can Kanye West Actually Run For President in 2020?. ARTICLE=> On July 4, Kanye West once again tweeted his plans to run for president.

Among West's supporters is Elon Musk, who responded almost immediately to West's tweet. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum analyzed West's chances at winning the 2020 election; some said that he would have to gain support from a smaller political party or run as an independent to get on the 2020 ballot.

Furthermore, the order encourages the FCC to revive “Broadband Nutrition Labels” to help customers compare internet service providers (ISPs), prevent rules that limit apartment tenants’ ISP options, limit ISPs’ early termination fees, and restore the net neutrality rules undone by the Trump administration.

Notable gains happened in the health care, transportation, construction and warehousing sectors, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

TITLE=> Aunt Jemima and Race in Branding. ARTICLE=> Quaker Oats, the parents company of the Aunt Jemima food products brand, announced their intent to re-brand the company to be less in line with racist stereotypes.

Coverage from right-rated outlets generally framed the steps as unnecessary, highlighting the history and supposed significance of these brand names to every day American life. Many left-rated voices have called for all branding based on racial stereotypes to be re-branded, arguing that they further dangerous stereotypes and racial biases. The fact that the family of Lillian Richard, the original inspiration for the Aunt Jemima logo, opposes the re-branding has been covered widely by right-rated outlets, with left-rated outlets reporting on the family's opposition scarcely.

Coverage from left-rated outlets tended to focus on international students' reaction to the reversal, while some coverage from some center- and right-rated outlets speculated that since the directive came without any economic or security justification, it could have been an effort to force colleges to open or to boost Trump's popularity with a restrictionist base.

TITLE=> DeSantis Signs Executive Order Prohibiting FL Schools From Enforcing Mask Mandate. ARTICLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order Friday that prohibits schools in the state from requiring students to wear face masks when they return to classrooms in the fall. The order states that school districts should not "violate Floridians' constitutional freedoms" and should "protect children with disabilities or health conditions who would be harmed by certain protocols such as face masking requirements." DeSantis' ruling comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that all K-12 students should wear masks when they return to school. While the Florida governor called the CDC's new guidelines "a huge mistake," he also noted that students whose parents want them to wear masks should be able to do so.   Left-rated outlets were more likely to list statistics related to the rise of COVID-19 cases with the new Delta variant spreading across the country and how Florida's vaccination rate has fallen behind other states. Right-rated outlets used terminology such as "forcing" students to wear masks and were more likely to mention the Brown University study that showed no correlation between school mask mandates and surges in COVID-19 cases. Center-rated outlets were more likely to feature a balanced mix of perspectives, pulling quotes from both DeSantis and the CDC.

TITLE=> Steve Bannon Indictment Dismissed by Federal Judge. ARTICLE=> A federal judge granted Steve Bannon's motion to dismiss the case against him over the objection of prosecutors who said it should stand, despite former President Donald Trump's pardon. The former Trump strategist pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he defrauded donors in a $25 million fund to build a wall along the southern border. After Trump pardoned Bannon in January, prosecutors asked the judge to let the indictment against him stand. In a ruling this week, Judge Analisa Torres said that it’s not the practice of the court to remove a defendant without a resolution of the indictment. Torres also noted that a pardon doesn’t make a defendant innocent of the crime. However, Torres noted in a filing that a pardon implies guilt, writing "If there be no guilt, there is no ground for forgiveness...it is an appeal to executive clemency. It is asked as a matter of favor to the guilty. It is granted not of right but of grace. A party is acquitted on the ground of innocence; he is pardoned through favor."  The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. 
TITLE=> Supreme Court to Review Mississippi Abortion Law. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court announced Monday it would review a major abortion dispute that could roll back abortion protections under Roe v. Wade. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, questions the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi law which banned abortions after 15 weeks. A federal judge struck down the law later that year, ruling that it conflicted with Roe v. Wade’s precedent that abortion could not be banned before “viability,” or the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth. The review, which was requested by Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, will be held after the Supreme Court’s summer recess and will focus on the question of “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.” Coverage was widespread and prominently featured in outlets across the spectrum. Coverage in right-rated outlets was less likely to mention the Supreme Court’s 6-3 conservative majority.

TITLE=> On Christmas Eve, News Outlets Use Christmas to Frame Different Headlines. ARTICLE=> News outlets on the left and right both used Christmas as a framing device for top headlines and stories, but each side tended to do this for different kinds of stories. Right-rated outlets, such as Fox News and Washington Examiner, tended to feature Christmas more prominently in coverage of congressional negotiations over stimulus checks. Some left- and center-rated outlets, like CNN and AP, published Christmas news stories about poverty and individuals’ economic struggles. Both sides were united on using Christmas to frame stories about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Coverage ranged from Bethlehem’s coronavirus lockdown and current shopping trends to Americans traveling despite the pandemic, with coverage from the right generally offering a more sympathetic view of holiday travelers.

On Monday, Biden's win was also certified in Michigan; the Trump administration authorized the release of materials to Biden's team to begin his transition into the White House on Monday.

Chauvin will be sentenced at a later date. The story was highlighted prominently throughout the spectrum Tuesday afternoon. Many focused on social justice demonstrations around the country Tuesday, as well as the potential for violence if the public wasn't satisfied with the verdict. Reports from left-rated sources often focused more on the prosecution's case against Chauvin and public criticism of his actions; coverage from right-rated outlets sometimes focused more on the defense's case, and highlighted concerns about the jury's ability to remain impartial.

ARTICLE=> On Friday, the House Freedom Caucus sent a letter to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) requesting he motion to vacate the House Speaker's chair, removing Nancy Pelosi from her position, next week. The conservative House Freedom Caucus cited Pelosi's refusal to seat Rep.

The White House has reportedly purchased 100 million doses from Pfizer; the New York Times reported Monday that Pfizer told the White House it cannot provide additional doses of the vaccine until June or July because other countries have bought up its supply.

The imminent vaccine authorization was covered by outlets across the spectrum. Trump's America-first vaccine order was covered widely by right-rated news outlets; left-and center-rated outlets tended to highlight Moderna and Pfizer's decision to skip the White House's vaccine announcement event.

ARTICLE=> An administrative review of the Mueller report's origins, led by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, has evolved into a criminal investigation. The reclassification allows Barr to file criminal charges, subpoena documents and arrange a grand jury. It is unclear what potential crimes are being investigated. President Donald Trump and many Republicans branded Mueller's report a "witch hunt," both before and after it concluded by finding no criminal conspiracy between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Many others maintain that Trump and Russia likely conspired, especially since the president was never cleared of obstructing justice.

TITLE=> Trump Discusses 2020 Election Results At Phoenix Rally. ARTICLE=> At an event titled “Rally for Election Integrity,” former President Donald Trump spoke to his supporters at the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix about the 2020 presidential election results. He thanked the “brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the Arizona State Senate” for supporting the ongoing audit that claims the 2020 election included elements of fraud. Trump also criticized President Joe Biden for adding critical race theory to school curriculums, not doing enough to stop the spread of COVID-19 and allowing the US to get "pushed around" by other countries. Additionally, the former president claimed that the US is on its way to "becoming a communist country." Left-rated outlets often emphasized how Trump is holding onto "false election claims" and how the Arizona Federal Theatre exceeded its capacity limits.

TITLE=> Attorney General Merrick Garland Launches DOJ Review of Hate Crimes, Instances of Bias. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department (DOJ) will conduct a monthlong internal review to determine how the agency can improve the tracking and prosecutions of hate crimes and bias incidents. In the memorandum to his staff, Garland said hate crimes have a “toxic effect” on society, and referenced a "recent rise in hate crime and hate incidents, particularly the disturbing trend in reports of violence against members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community," though he did not reference the recent Atlanta shootings, in which six Asian Americans were killed. The DOJ's 30-day internal review will evaluate the government's capacity to track and identify hate incidents, evaluate the use of civil enforcement authority to respond to incidents of bias, and evaluate whether additional money is needed to support law enforcement's response. The effort will be led by Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin until the Senate confirms a permanent Deputy Attorney General.

TITLE=> Voting-Machine Company Sues Fox News For Defamation Over Election Claims. ARTICLE=> Voting-machine company Smartmatic is suing Fox News for allegedly making defamatory comments on-air about the company’s products after the 2020 election. Smartmatic, along with Dominion Voting Systems, faced allegations that their software changed votes cast for former President Donald Trump to votes for President Joe Biden. This claim was disputed by both companies, and later dismissed by U.S. courts. Smartmatic's lawsuit claimed that Fox hosts Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and Jeanine Pirro, and two former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, conspired to spread a "disinformation campaign" that the company helped rig the election. In December, Smartmatic sent Fox a letter demanding “a full and complete retraction of all false and defamatory statements and reports published by Fox News.” Fox responded by airing a short segment addressing misinformation about Smartmatic. Smartmatic's lawsuit comes after another Dominion also sued Giuliani and Powell for $1.3 billion. Fox News called the lawsuits "meritless" and says it plans to fight it in courts. The $2.7 billion suit was filed on Thursday in New York state court and is one of the largest libel suits ever issued. Outlets from the center and the right tended to focus on the details of the lawsuit. Some left-rated outlet used Dominion's claim of a "disinformation campaign" to criticize Fox News.

Another author (rated Center), writing in MarketWatch, described how President Trump could lose his political base by pushing liberal policies in response to the crisis.
TITLE=> AstraZeneca Says Its COVID-19 Vaccine is 79% Effective. ARTICLE=> In U.S. clinical trials, AstraZeneca said its COVID-19 vaccine was shown to be safe and 79% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, providing a vote of confidence for the shot and a pathway for its authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

TITLE=> Study Finds Delta COVID-19 Variant Doubles Risk Of Hospitalization, Vaccine Still Effective. ARTICLE=> A Scottish study released Monday found that the Delta COVID-19 variant carries double the risk of hospitalization as the previously dominant strain in Scotland, called the Alpha strain, but that two-dose vaccines are still effective against the Delta strain. Researchers determined that the Delta strain, which originated in India, became the dominant strain in Scotland on May 19; the previous dominant strain was the Alpha strain, which originated in Kent, England. The study's findings suggested Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine was found to give 79% protection from the Delta variant, while the same vaccine provided 92% protection against the Alpha strain; Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine provided 60% protection from the Delta variant, while it gave 73% protection from the Alpha variant.

The new order applies to areas with "substantial" or "high" levels of transmissions, which as of Wednesday included roughly 80% of the nation’s counties, according to CDC data.

ARTICLE=> As Election Day on Nov. 3 draws near, President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden compete to win several battleground states that could decide the election, including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All the states mentioned, some historically Democrat, voted for Trump in the 2016 election. RealClearPolitics' national polling average suggests Biden leads in all six states, though by a slim margin in some states such as Florida. Analysis from all sides of the political spectrum analyzed the current and projected swing state polls to predict the outcome of the election. Analysis from right-rated outlets tended to focus on similarities between this year's poll numbers and 2016's poll numbers; some highlighted a 2016 article from prominent pollster Nate Silver.

TITLE=> Senate Kicks Off Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court Hearing. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court began Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Monday. This is the start of a four-day hearing in which Barrett will face a line of questioning from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. During the hearing, Barrett is expected to answer questions regarding her position on abortion, the role of precedent, the Affordable Care Act, and if she plans on recusing herself from litigation on the upcoming presidential election. Since Barrett is expected to have support from a majority of both the committee and the Senate, many speculate that the questioning will have little effect on the outcome of Barrett's hearing. Coverage from the left tended to analyze Barrett's stances on individual issues such as abortion and the Affordable Care Act; some left-rated outlets also highlighted D.C. protests in response to Barrett's appointment. Several right-rated outlets highlighted Democrats' criticism of Barrett, often coming to her defense.

TITLE=> Senate Parliamentarian Allows Democrats to Bypass Republican Filibuster on Two Bills. ARTICLE=> On Monday, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that Democrats can pass two more bills without Republican support by using the budget reconciliation process once again this fiscal year. This allows Democrats to pass two budget-related bills with a simple majority instead of the usual 60-vote threshold requirement. Democrats have already passed two reconciliation bills, with one focused on fiscal year 2021 and one focused on fiscal year 2022. The decision comes from MacDonough’s interpretation of Section 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which states lawmakers may revise a budget resolution before the end of the fiscal year that it covers. The ruling now allows Democrats to edit the 2021 budget resolution they already passed, and include instructions for another bill. A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that “no decisions have been made on a legislative path forward using Section 304 and some parameters still need to be worked out.”While details of Democrats' plan for this additional opportunity have yet to be released, many speculate it will be used to approve President Joe Biden's multi-trillion dollar infrastructure plan, which is split into two bills. The story received consistent coverage from across the political spectrum.

Anthony, a women’s suffrage leader who was arrested for illegally voting as a woman in 1872.

The pardon was covered by outlets on all sides, with some outlets covering the context of the 2020 election and Trump’s polling with women.

ARTICLE=> After the first Democratic debate held on Wednesday, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D - HI) was the most-searched candidate on Google. Google Analytics released an infographic showing which candidates were the most searched in each state. Gabbard went from relatively unsearched to a trending search in most states. It is still unclear whether she 'won' the debate, however, it is clear she walked away with more online attention than before the debates. Vox argues that Gabbard's online rise was predictable because her Wikipedia page searches were on par with Biden, Sanders, and Warren's for the past month or so. It is still up to speculation whether tonight's debate could yield a similar popularity spike for another candidate.

TITLE=> Biden Waives Executive Privilege on Some Jan. 6 Documents. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden waived executive privilege on the first set of documents requested by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced Friday. In doing so, Biden rejected a request by former President Donald Trump to withhold the documents under executive privilege, setting up a potential legal battle. In a letter to the National Archives, which currently possesses the documents, White House Counsel Dana Remus argued that executive privilege "should not be used to shield, from Congress or the public, information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself.” Also on Friday, it was reported that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon would defy the House committee’s subpoena, while former Trump aides Mark Meadows and Kash Patel were engaging with the committee.  Coverage was more prominently featured in left- and center-rated outlets on Friday. Coverage differed on describing Biden’s move as a standalone decision or as a rejection of Trump’s request to withhold the documents.
TITLE=> FDA Advisors Endorse Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine Booster for Some Groups.

The panel ultimately advised the FDA to release the shots for people 65 and older, people ages 18 to 64 deemed to be at high-risk of contracting severe Covid-19, and people with jobs that put them at high risk of severe COVID-19. The recommendation followed the FDA's approval of Pfizer's booster shot late last month. The agency general follows guidance from its advisory panels, though it's not required to. 	Coverage was prominent and similar across the political spectrum. Many reports highlighted how some panelists were still skeptical of the immediate need for the shots but ended up endorsing them anyway.
TITLE=> U.S. Reaches 25 Million COVID-19 Cases. ARTICLE=> The United States surpassed 25 million confirmed COVID-19 cases Sunday morning, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

TITLE=> Biden's Supreme Court Commission Raises Concerns About Adding Justices. ARTICLE=> A commission formed by President Joe Biden to study potential changes to the Supreme Court has raised concerns about increasing the number of justices. Preliminary draft materials released on Thursday contained warnings from some members that feared the "partisan maneuver" would “undermine, rather than enhance” the Supreme Court's legitimacy. The bipartisan commission met Friday to assess term limits for justices, limiting the number of justices that a president can name, and whether expanding the Supreme Court would be "wise." Progressive Democrats who have pushed to expand the number of seats said that the draft "misses the mark," alleging that the group is "biased" against court-packing. Biden formed the 36-member commission in April in order to receive “analysis and appraisal” from both sides of the current debate over the Supreme Court. He will receive a final report from the commission in mid-November. Left-rated outlets argued that the high court's conservative majority continues to "empower corporations, prevent action on climate change and roll back civil rights, voting rights and women’s rights to control their own bodies." Right-rated voices highlighted how Democrats "fumed" over the initial draft and were more likely to cover how two conservative jurists resigned from the commission after the meeting on Friday.

The agreement brings the total number of Pfizer vaccine doses bought by the U.S. to 200 million, or enough to vaccinate 100 million people. The deal also includes an option for the U.S. to buy another 400 million doses. Coverage was mostly balanced across bias ratings, with more original coverage published in center- and left-rated outlets. Some coverage discussed concerns over Pfizer’s manufacturing capacity.

TITLE=> UK Begins Distribution of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. ARTICLE=> The United Kingdom has begun distributing the world’s first fully tested, clinically authorized COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine. The first recipient was a 90-year-old woman named Margaret Keenan, followed by an 81-year-old man named William Shakespeare. The vaccine, developed by American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech, was approved by British authorities in early December. The U.K. has so far received enough doses for 400,000 people, and will prioritize distribution to health workers and people older than 80. The FDA is expected to make a decision on U.S. vaccine authorization later this week. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides, with some coverage using a variation of the phrase “first in the Western world” to account for the existence of other non-approved vaccines, such as the vaccine distributed by China’s Sinopharm. Coverage from left-rated outlets generally expressed more confidence in the vaccine’s safety than coverage from right-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Two Associates Of Rudy Giuliani Are Arrested For Campaign Finance Violations.

TITLE=> IMF Lowers 2021 Global Growth Forecast, Signals Inflation Uncertainty. ARTICLE=> The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday signaled slowing economic momentum and rising uncertainty, lowering its 2021 global GDP growth forecast to 5.9% from its July projection of 6.0%. The 2022 growth projection remained at 4.9%, and the new projection is still significantly higher than 2020’s -3.1% decline. The IMF explained the new number by pointing to supply chain disruptions in advanced economies and pandemic dynamics in low-income developing countries. IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath also warned that central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve should “chart contingent actions, announce clear triggers, and act in line with that communication” to mitigate the “risks of rising inflation expectations.” Coverage was found primarily in business-focused outlets on Tuesday. Coverage in right-rated outlets was somewhat more likely to highlight inflation concerns, with some center-rated outlets covering IMF statements on inflation and GDP growth separately. 
TITLE=> Trump Says He Will Issue Order Temporarily Suspending Immigration Into U.S.. ARTICLE=> President Trump on Monday said he will sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States amid the coronavirus pandemic in order to protect Americans and American jobs.

TITLE=> Democrats Split on Biden Attending the Presidential Debates. ARTICLE=> With less than 60 days to go until the 2020 presidential election, The Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled three debates between President Donald Trump and Joe Biden, beginning Sept. 29, likely with some changes pending due to public health precautions. Some Democrats, however, are urging Biden to scrap the debates altogether, citing Trump's purported tendency to make false claims during the last election's debates. Others, however, encourage the debates, and the Biden campaign has already committed to all three. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is pushing for debates to be moved up; campaign manager Bill Stepien said on Fox and Friends that by the time the first debate airs on Sept. 29, 16 states will have already voted. Some voices from the left questioned the necessity of debates, saying they fail to foster substantive discussion; others also highlighted Trump's alleged tendency to make false claims during debates. Some voices from the right framed the left's push to cancel debates as evidence of their concern for Biden's debate ability.
TITLE=> House Passes Bill Requiring Universal Background Checks on Firearm Sales. ARTICLE=> The House passed a bill that would require universal background checks on all firearm sales, with eight Republicans voting in favor and two Democrats voting against.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Trump Opposes Democrat Proposals for More USPS Funding. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump said Thursday in an interview with Fox News that he wanted to keep new funding away from the United States Postal Service (USPS), linking it to his skepticism about mail-in voting and blaming Democrats for holding up new COVID-19 coronavirus relief over extra USPS funding. Coverage from many left-rated sources and some center-rated sources framed Trump's comments as him admitting to taking steps to undermine mail-in voting. Some left-rated voices accused him of active voter suppression. Coverage of the comments from right-rated sources focused more on quoting the comments, and rarely interpreted them the way most coverage from left-rated sources did; a few reports mentioned that FedEx and UPS stocks rose on the news. Some right-rated voices accused Democrats of abusing mail-in voting and the USPS for political gain.
TITLE=> Trump Rips Boeing. ARTICLE=> Donald Trump made a statement today about the Boeing Air Force One plane costing 4 billion dollars and the fact that he wanted to cancel the deal.
TITLE=> Trump Officials Push to Review, Edit CDC Coronavirus Reports. ARTICLE=> Communications aides at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have requested to review and edit the coronavirus-related reports released weekly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Politico reported Saturday. Some emails from communications aides to CDC senior officials said that the agency’s reports could undermine President Donald Trump's messages about the outbreak, according to emails reviewed by Politico. Joe Biden’s campaign responded to the report with a press release on Saturday condemning the HHS’ involvement in the CDC and framing it as “the latest example of Trump’s refusal to be honest about this pandemic.”  Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum tended to focus on the details of the reports. Some right-rated outlets tended to frame the story as Trump aides reviewing the reports "to better align with president's upbeat messaging."
TITLE=> Hope Hicks To Return To White House. ARTICLE=> Former White House communications director Hope Hicks is rejoining President Donald Trump's administration after a two-year hiatus, according to reports this week. The 31-year-old, one of Trump's closest aides before resigning the post, will work with the Republican's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in a different capacity. Coverage from right-leaning outlets framed Hicks' return in a largely positive light. Some left-leaning outlets, meanwhile, suggested that the news signaled a pattern of reinstating and promoting Trump's most loyal allies following Democrats' impeachment inquiry in Congress.

TITLE=> Trump Fires Intelligence Chief Who Handled Ukraine Complaint. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump has fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community who alerted Congress last year to the whistleblower complaint about his dealings with Ukraine. Atkinson is the latest official involved in Trump's impeachment to be removed from office, following the firing of National Security Council official Alexander Vindman and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Many outlets on both the left and right highlighted the timing of the firing, which comes amid the government's response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
TITLE=> Senate Democrats Reveal Proposal to Decriminalize Marijuana. ARTICLE=> Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, unveiled a plan Wednesday to federally decriminalize marijuana. The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act would remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and create a tax system for sales of the substance; it would also allow appeals for those in prison for marijuana charges, and expunge federal nonviolent marijuana convictions. Schumer warned Wednesday that the bill is currently a "draft bill," and that it does not yet have enough support, but has majority support from Senate Democrats. The bill would need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. This comes after the U.S. House passed a bill to decriminalize marijuana in December. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Outlets from the left and center tended to provide speculation on the bill's likelihood of passing the Senate; some on the right criticized Schumer's proposed tax system for marijuana. 
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden's DNC Acceptance Speech. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden formally accepted the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination Thursday in a speech to cap off the four-day Democratic National Convention (DNC). The speech touched on the importance of unity, criticism of President Donald Trump, and "four historic crises" happening now: the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis, the deepest economic recession since the Great Depression, climate change and "the most compelling call for racial justice since the 60’s." Read a transcript of Biden's speech from NPR.org. Many left-rated voices framed the speech as a success, painting Biden as the "man for the moment" and praising his stated focus on unity. Some right-rated voices noted the speech's "political effectiveness", while also accusing Biden of discrepancies between his speech's message, and his political record and overall 2020 platform.

TITLE=> Outgoing Kentucky Gov. Bevin Pardons 428 Criminals on Last Day. ARTICLE=> This post was updated Saturday 12/14 at 10:19 a.m. EST to include a story from Fox Online News Outgoing Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) pardoned 428 criminals on Thursday, his last day in office, as first reported by the Louisville Courier-Journal. Bevin, who received a campaign endorsement from President Donald Trump before losing to new governor Andy Beshear (D) last month, argued in his pardon order that due process was infringed upon for some of the pardoned, including a convicted rapist; state prosecutors said they were not consulted on the decisions beforehand. Reports focused mostly on specific crimes committed by some of the 428, and also on the fact that one of the pardoned raised money for Bevin in 2015. The majority of reporting on this topic is from left-leaning outlets.
TITLE=> U.S. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer Fired Over Seal Controversy. ARTICLE=> U.S. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer has been fired over his handling of the case of a Navy Seal demoted for misconduct.

TITLE=> Hunter Biden Says Laptop 'Could Be' His In CBS Interview. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden addressed his battle with substance abuse and his laptop scandal in two interviews with CBS. Ahead of the 2020 election, the New York Post reported that Hunter Biden left a laptop at a Delaware repair shop, and that the laptop allegedly contained details of his business dealings in Ukraine, as well as images of Hunter Biden using illicit drugs and sexually explicit photos. President Biden previously claimed the information on the laptop was part of a Russian disinformation "smear campaign." For the interview on "CBS Sunday Morning," Hunter Biden told Tracy Smith, "there could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was the — that it was Russian intelligence." In October, former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said that the intelligence community did not find evidence to support the laptop's information was Russian disinformation. In his other interview with CBS' Anthony Mason, Hunter Biden also detailed his history with alcohol and cocaine addiction, and described an intervention his family held during the 2020 presidential campaign; he also spoke of his memoir, Beautiful Things, which comes out April 6. Coverage of the interviews from left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on Hunter Biden's substance abuse, his family intervention, and his upcoming book. Coverage from the right tended to lead with his comments about the laptop, and some voices from the right also pointed out how Facebook and Twitter limited the spread of stories on Biden’s overseas business dealings in October, and claimed that outlets on the left were quick to "dismiss" the Biden laptop stories as Russian disinformation. NPR also corrected a claim on Thursday that reports about Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop had been “discredited” by the intelligence community.
TITLE=> YouTube Removes Project Veritas Video on Google Bias. ARTICLE=> YouTube, which is owned by Google, removed a video created by nonprofit Project Veritas, a site that aims to expose corruption, about Google and its alleged bias. The video showed undercover footage of Google's Head of Responsible Innovation Jen Gennai discussing the tech giant’s search algorithm. Those on the right say Gennai’s comments mean Google is biased and the search giant is taking a role in influencing what information is available to shape elections. Gennai says the video was selectively edited to appear ominous. As of Tuesday evening, the story is largely being ignored by media outlets on the left.
TITLE=> Police Confiscate Rifle from St. Louis Couple Who Pulled Firearms on Protesters. ARTICLE=> On Friday, authorities confiscated the rifle of Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple who confronted protesters in their neighborhood with firearms on June 28. The McCloskeys later said on Sean Hannity's show that the protesters allegedly threatened violence. The St. Louis Police Department confiscated the firearm as a part of an ongoing investigation into the incident. No charges have been made against the McCloskeys, as the warrant was only for their guns. When it comes to wording, some right-rated outlets used words like "raid,"in their headlines, while many other left- and center-rated outlets framed their headlines as "police execute search warrants," although the McCloskey's lawyer told NBC News Saturday that the McCloskey's home was not searched by police and they voluntarily gave up the rifle.
TITLE=> Bannon Testifies Before House Intel Committee. ARTICLE=> Steve Bannon appears before the House Intelligence Committee to answer questions about his role in Trump's campaign and any connection to Russian operatives.

TITLE=> Lockdowns Return as Coronavirus Cases Rise in Some Areas. ARTICLE=> States across the country are seeing rises in COVID-19 coronavirus cases, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue special holiday travel guidance and governors to consider and impose new lockdown measures. Over 30 states now have facemask mandates, and three states — Ohio, New Mexico and California — have issued curfews or stay-at-home orders as of Friday afternoon. Outlets on all sides have covered the restrictions, their potential economic impacts, and projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden statement that there's "no circumstance which I can see that would require a total national shutdown." Some reports from right-rated sources concentrated on concerns from health professionals that more lockdowns could have severe psychological side effects.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Biden and the COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory. ARTICLE=> The theory that the COVID-19 pandemic began with a laboratory leak in Wuhan, China remains a subject of discussion across the spectrum, and President Joe Biden's handling of the theory remains in the spotlight. Biden recently directed intelligence agencies to probe the pandemic's genesis and to report back to him within 90 days. CNN reported this week that Biden shut down a Trump administration effort to investigate the pandemic's origins earlier this year, citing concerns about the quality of evidence. Biden's renewed focus on COVID-19's origins reportedly came after U.S. intelligence revealed a host of still-unexamined data pertaining to the investigation. 	Coverage across the spectrum analyzed what the consequences of the investigation would be for China if the theory is proven true. Right-rated media has focused more on the theory overall than left- and center-rated sources. Coverage from left-rated sources often concentrated on the new investigations, possible evidence, and evaluating the theory's likelihood. Many right-rated voices remained highly critical of Biden, public health officials and the mainstream media for purportedly ignoring the lab leak hypothesis until now, accusing them of allowing their disdain for Trump to cloud their judgment when it came to evaluating the theory; Trump was one of the narrative's early proponents.

Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) announced on Monday that the state will seek to have it replaced with a statue of civil rights icon Barbara Johns.
TITLE=> Biden Unveils $6 Trillion Budget Proposal, Excludes Hyde Amendment. ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Joe Biden revealed his $6 trillion budget proposal for the 2022 fiscal year, which includes a tax hike on businesses and an increase in safety net spending, and excludes the Hyde Amendment. The new proposal includes Biden’s $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan and $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, and is a large increase from the previously-proposed $1.5 trillion 2022 budget. The plan also calls for raising annual federal spending to $8.2 trillion by 2031 and would keep annual deficits above $1.3 trillion for the next decade, with the federal government spending more as a percentage of the economy than any year since World War II, except 2020 and 2021. The White House projects the economy to expand by 4.3 percent in 2022, and that the unemployment rate will fall from 6.1 percent as of last month to 4.1 percent next year. The budget also excludes the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion and has been included in spending legislation for decades; Biden had supported the amendment before reversing his position during his presidential campaign.  Outlets across the political spectrum provided analysis regarding the budget and its likelihood of passing; the Hyde Amendment's exclusion also received coverage from across the spectrum.

TITLE=> Bill to Avert Shutdown, Suspend Debt Ceiling Blocked By Senate Republicans. ARTICLE=> Senate Republicans on Monday voted against a motion to begin debate on a Democrat-proposed stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown and suspend the debt ceiling. The motion, which needed 60 votes to avoid a Republican filibuster, failed in a 48-50 party line vote. If Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling by mid-October, the U.S. government could default on its debts for the first time in history. Republicans stuck by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s pledge to withhold Republican support for any Democrat bill that extended the debt ceiling. McConnell argued that raising the debt ceiling would allow Democrats to spend more under their current budget reconciliation plan. Democrats refused to include a debt limit suspension in their budget reconciliation bill, which Republicans cannot filibuster. Much of the debt the government could end up defaulting on was undertaken by Republicans during the Trump presidency; the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects the national debt to rise by $3 trillion in 2021. Coverage in most left- and center-rated outlets framed the issue as a choice by Senate Republicans. Coverage was relatively sparse in right-rated outlets on Monday and tended to focus on Democrats’ criticism of Republicans.
TITLE=> Actor Jussie Smollett Is Arrested Over False Attack Report. ARTICLE=> Actor Jussie Smollett is taken into custody and faces a felony charge for allegedly filing a false police report.
TITLE=> Whistleblower Complaint Declassified. ARTICLE=> The whistleblower complaint alleging President Donald Trump's misconduct in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has been declassified. Many on the left consider the declassification another cause for Trump's impeachment; some on the right place less stock in the whistleblower's complaint, as the person apparently wasn't a witness to the call-in-question.
TITLE=> July Jobs Report. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy added 1.8 million jobs in July, and the unemployment rate fell from 11.1% to 10.2%. Each figure slightly beat expectations; the pace of hiring went down after a record 4.8 million jobs were added in June. All coverage framed the numbers in the context of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The expectation-beating statistics were a focus of coverage on all sides, particularly from right-rated outlets. Most left- and center-rated coverage gave more prominent attention to the slowed hiring pace.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rejects Texas Lawsuit Challenging Election Results. ARTICLE=> On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case launched by Texas and backed by the Trump campaign that sought to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential elections in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtonfiled the case Tuesday, arguing that the battleground states violated state and Constitution election laws when state election officials and courts ordered modifications to election protocol due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The Supreme Court decided 7-2 not to hear the case on the grounds that Texas lacked standing to pursue the case, saying it has not demonstrated a "judicially cognizable interest." Coverage from left- and center-rate outlets tended to highlight the details of the case; some coverage from right-rated outlets highlighted other lawsuits across the country challenging election results.
TITLE=> Obama Warns About Social Media Risks. ARTICLE=> Former President Barack Obama warns that social media risks splintering society in an interview with Prince Harry.
TITLE=> Biden Proposes $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Plan, $1400 Checks For Americans. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, President-elect Joe Biden called for swift action on his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 economic relief proposal. Biden's proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, would allot $400 billion for COVID-19 tests and vaccines, $400 billion in aid to businesses and $1 trillion in direct relief to Americans in the form of $1,400 one-time payments. It would also include $400 a week in extended federal unemployment insurance through September. The American Rescue Plan has two phases: rescue and recovery. The stimulus plan is part of the rescue phase, while the recovery phase will be unveiled in February and includes investments in infrastructure and clean energy. On Friday afternoon, Biden will outline his vaccination plan to administer 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots during his first 100 days in office. Outlets from across the political spectrum gave analysis of the details of Biden's plan and its likelihood to pass Congress during President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

TITLE=> Senate Reaches Organizing Deal as Democrats Move Towards Budget Reconciliation on Stimulus. ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday that he and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed to an organizing resolution, which is widely expected to give half of committee seats to Democrats under a 2001 precedent. A day earlier, Senate Democrats passed a resolution starting the budget reconciliation process for President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill after gaining the support of moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin. If budget reconciliation is successful, it will allow the bill to be passed with a simple majority instead of the usual 60 votes, and Republicans would not be able to slow the process with a filibuster. Coverage varied slightly across all outlets, with some articles focusing on angles like Republicans’ stimulus counter-proposal or Sen. Manchin’s reluctance to support reconciliation. Some center- and left-rated outlets published explainers on budget reconciliation.
TITLE=> Republicans Ask Michigan to Audit Wayne County Election Results. ARTICLE=> The Republican National Committee and the Michigan Republican Party sent a letter to the state's election board Saturday requesting it to adjourn for 14 days to allow for an audit of ballots in Wayne County amid allegations of “numerical anomalies” and counting irregularities. Michigan's election board is set to meet Monday to decide whether to certify elections results or seek more time to proceed with an audit. On Wednesday, two Republican officials sought to rescind their vote to certify the county's election results after purportedly receiving a phone call from President Donald Trump Tuesday night. The Washington Post reported Saturday that Michigan’s attorney general is allegedly exploring whether officials "risk committing crimes" by seeking to block the election certification after Trump's call. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the details and claims within the Michigan GOP's letter. Some reports from left-rated outlets highlighted the Michigan attorney general's exploration of potential crimes.
TITLE=> Emails Show Trump Pressed DOJ to Back Election Fraud Claims. ARTICLE=> The Trump White House urged Department of Justice officials to challenge the 2020 election results based on unproven claims of fraud, according to emails released Tuesday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In one case, former President Donald Trump’s assistant emailed fraud claims to then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen less than an hour before Trump tweeted that Rosen would replace then-Attorney General William Barr, who had publicly stated that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. In another case, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue wrote “Pure insanity” in response to a fraud theory sent by Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows. Right-rated outlets were less likely to cover this story as of Tuesday afternoon; left- and center-rated outlets tended to feature it prominently on homepages. Some coverage in left-rated outlets called Trump’s fraud claims “outlandish” and cited the “pure insanity” quote in headlines.
TITLE=> Surge of Migrants at Southern Border Becoming Early Challenge for Biden Admin. ARTICLE=> U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 100,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February. The number of apprehensions, particularly of single adults and unaccompanied minors, have risen increasingly in the past ten months. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week that Border Patrol is "on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years." President Biden said Tuesday that he doesn't currently have plans to visit the southern border, and discouraged would-be migrants from traveling there. Recently pitched immigration bills, both from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, are currently being discussed in Congress. Outlets on all sides, particularly the left and center, have focused on the rising number of unaccompanied children at the border and public health concerns about their detainment. Some recent reports from right-rated outlets framed Democrats as divided on the issue, and highlighted DHS requests for increased National Guard assistance along the border. Right-rated media has focused on the surge more overall, often painting the Biden administration as hesitant to confront the issue.
TITLE=> Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospitalized After Fall. ARTICLE=> Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized on Thursday morning after fracturing three ribs in a fall.
TITLE=> Lawmakers React to U.S. Killing of Iranian General. ARTICLE=> There were stark differences visible in reactions from members of Congress to the Pentagon-ordered missile strike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani Thursday in Baghdad. Some lawmakers praised the move as necessary and decisive action in the wake of recent violence in the region; others condemned the move, saying President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in bypassing congressional approval for the strike. Many reports from left-rated outlets focused on criticisms of the decision from prominent impeachment figures such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff (D-CA), who each said that Trump should have sought congressional guidance before ordering the strike; many right-rated sources concentrated reporting on Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) reaction, which questioned Trump's decision to "assassinate a foreign official."
TITLE=> US Judge Restores White House Press Pass To Jim Acosta. ARTICLE=> A US Judge restores White House press credentials to CNN's Jim Acosta, saying there should be due process before the removal of a press pass.

TITLE=> Left and Right Divided Over Harvard's Decision to Rescind Kyle Kashuv's Admissions Offer. ARTICLE=> Harvard rescinded its admission offer to gun rights advocate and Parkland shooting survivor Kyle Kashuv after a former classmate revealed Kashuv had used the n-word multiple times in a private Google document with friends when he was 16. Those on the left have defended Harvard's decision, pointing out that racism is unacceptable and that Harvard has denied applicants over private messages in the past. Conservatives, on the other hand, have said Kashuv should be forgiven — that he has apologized and grown since he made the comments. They point out that almost everyone has said or done something in the past that they are not proud of, and that Kashuv's past comments would not have been unearthed and weaponized if not for his pro-gun activism.
TITLE=> Trump Gives Speech on Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> President Trump gave a much-anticipated speech on Monday night regarding the U.S. strategy on Afghanistan going forward. Trump committed to having U.S troops in Afghanistan, but did not give a timetable for troop removal.

TITLE=> Supreme Court Dismisses 2020 Election Appeal. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court decided Monday not to hear a challenge to the Pennsylvania state court’s ruling that 2020 presidential election ballots could be counted if they were received up to three days after Election Day. The decision to dismiss the case came as the nation's high court rejected several different election-related matters. Three of the court's nine justices dissented in the Pennsylvania decision: conservatives Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito. In his dissent, Thomas acknowledged that the case wouldn't have impacted the election's outcome, but said "the decision to leave election law hidden beneath a shroud of doubt is baffling. By doing nothing, we invite further confusion and erosion of voter confidence." The decision came as the court also elected to allow the Manhattan district attorney to obtain former President Donald Trump's tax returns. Reports from across the spectrum, particularly from left- and center-rated outlets, framed the news as the formal end of election-related legal disputes.

TITLE=> Trump's Tulsa Rally Turnout Lower Than Expected. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump resumed his election campaign at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday. Though Trump's campaign manager tweeted June 15 that the Tulsa rally had received over 1 million ticket requests, the Tulsa Fire Department reported that approximately 6,200 people scanned tickets. Many left- and center-rated outlets highlighted the rally's low attendance and focused on the claim that teens and young adults on social media spread a campaign urging others to reserve tickets to the rally without intending to show up. Some right-rated outlets focused on Trump's speech, which covered the COVID-19 outbreak, the protests, the media and socialism. Several voices from the right also highlighted the reported 10.1 million digital viewers.
TITLE=> Yellen Urges Congress to Raise or Suspend Debt Ceiling. ARTICLE=> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to raise or suspend the debt ceiling as soon as possible on Wednesday, warning that inaction could lead to a historic default in October. “A delay that calls into question the federal government’s ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets,” Yellen said. The debt ceiling was suspended in 2019 until July 2021, and the Treasury has since taken “extraordinary measures” to raise funds without issuing new debt; Yellen said those measures will expire in October. While promising to explore multiple options to raise the debt ceiling, Pelosi said she would not include such legislation in Democrats' $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill. Thus, a debt ceiling bill could require the support of at least 10 Senate Republicans, at least 46 of whom have signed a pledge not to contribute to Democrats’ efforts to raise the cap. Coverage was most prominent in center-rated outlets, particularly those focused on business and D.C. politics. Coverage of Yellen’s remarks came among several related stories on the negotiations surrounding Democrats’ budget reconciliation bill.

TITLE=> US Launches Airstrike Against Iranian-Backed Militia In Syria. ARTICLE=> On Thursday the U.S. military carried out an airstrike in Syria against a structure reportedly belonging to an Iran-backed militia, in a response to attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq. Multiple structures apparently belonging to the Iraqi border-based Shia militia groups, Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Sayyid al Shuhada, were struck. Both groups are suspected of having received funding and military support from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard. An official told Reuters that President Joe Biden approved the strike, making it the first known military action by the new president, who had previously emphasized intent to focus on China and Russia. "These strikes were authorized in response to recent attacks against American and coalition personnel in Iraq, and to ongoing threats to those personnel," Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Thursday. The story received coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Some outlets from the right and center compared Biden's Iran approach to that of former President Donald Trump.

TITLE=> Susan Rice Email Adds Layer to Flynn Controversy. ARTICLE=> Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell declassified an email Tuesday that Obama-era national security advisor Susan Rice had sent herself on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. The email contains information on how President Barack Obama's administration planned to handle "sensitive information related to Russia," and pertains to a January 5th, 2017 meeting between Obama and top officials including Rice and then-Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey. Right-rated outlets have reported and commented on this story more frequently than their center-rated and left-rated counterparts. Many right-rated voices cited the email as evidence that Obama and Comey conspired directly to undermine the incoming administration. Conversely, some left-rated outlets suggested that the Rice email actually contradicts those allegations, and is being circulated by right-rated media to distract from the current administration's purported mismanagement of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
TITLE=> Hiring Slows in April, Falling Short of Expectations. ARTICLE=> American employers added 266,000 jobs in April, a significant drop from March that fell short of many economists' predictions. The unemployment rate also rose from 6% to 6.1%. Still, it's the fourth consecutive month that businesses have added jobs as the economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The news made headlines on major news sites across the spectrum Friday. Many outlets on all sides framed the news as disappointing, but also highlighted positive signs such as vaccine progress and overall economic expansion in the past several months. Some reports from left-rated sources exuded more concern about specific industries and demographics.
TITLE=> Biden Administration Orders ICE, CBP to Stop Using Terms 'Alien,' 'Illegal'. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration reportedly ordered ICE and CBP to stop using terms like “illegal alien,” in an attempt to make the immigration system more “humane.” The new changes replace “alien” with “noncitizen or migrant,” “illegal” with “undocumented,” and “assimilation” with “integration.” The changes were first reported by The Washington Post, which obtained memos sent to department heads at ICE and CBP on Monday. A similar memo was sent in February by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services head Tracy Renaud to members of that agency. President Joe Biden also proposed a bill to replace words like “alien” from U.S. immigration laws on his first day in office. Coverage was more common in mainstream right-rated outlets than mainstream left-rated outlets. While coverage was mostly similar across the spectrum, coverage in right-rated outlets was more likely to point out that terms like “alien” are used in federal law.

TITLE=> U.S. Government Misled the Public About War in Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> Documents obtained by the Washington Post show evidence of senior U.S. officials intentionally misleading the public about the state of war in Afghanistan over the past three presidential administrations. Interviews detailed in the documents suggest officials painted a more positive picture of the war than privately acknowledged and deliberately spun statistics to support public statements. All other coverage was in reaction to the Post's initial report published Monday morning.
TITLE=> Reactions Vary on Cohen Tapes. ARTICLE=> Reactions vary to the news that President Trump's ex-lawyer recorded him discussing a payment to a former Playboy model, with some arguing it means little unless Trump used federal donations, while others say the implications are far-reaching.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) invited Biden to make the address in a letter released publicly on Tuesday. The annual event, which is called the State of the Union from a president's second year on, provides a platform for the commander in chief to lay out an agenda, and to sell it to both lawmakers and the public. The speech comes amid domestic challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and the border crisis, and the foreign policy challenges with Russia over Ukraine, China over Taiwan, and Iran over its nuclear program.
TITLE=> Matthew Whittaker Replaces Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. ARTICLE=> Matthew Whittaker was appointed to serve as the United States Attorney General this past Wednesday. He was appointed by President Trump after Jeff Sessions resigned at Trump's request.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Facebook Sued Over Potential Antitrust Violations. ARTICLE=> The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and attorneys general from 46 states, Washington D.C. and Guam filed lawsuits against Facebook Wednesday. The suits accuse the social media giant of illegally suppressing competition to gain popularity among potential users. Facebook allegedly broke competition law by purchasing popular social media app Instagram in 2012 and messaging app WhatsApp in 2014; the suits seek to force the company to give up ownership of the apps. A Facebook spokesperson responded by pointing out that the FTC approved the acquisitions at the time. Some left-rated voices sided with the FTC and attorneys general, saying Facebook abused its power and that the government should have intervened sooner. Some right-rated voices argued that the lawsuits overlooked the benefits of Facebook's acquisitions for customers. Center-rated Wired analyzed Facebook employee emails in an attempt to add context to news of the lawsuits.

Teachers and students from kindergarten up to college have moved learning completely online, away from physical classroom settings and in accordance with social distancing. Theories on the pros and cons of this differ from left to right. Some right-rated voices downplayed potential drawbacks and investigated potential positive outcomes for kids missing out on school; some left- and center-rated voices focused more on the benefits of in-person learning and possible repercussions of losing the classroom environment for students.
TITLE=> Big Tech Responds to Australian Proposed Regulatory News Deal. ARTICLE=> Australia has proposed new bargaining code that would make big tech platforms pay news publishers for their content, or else be subject to large fines. The proposed legislation, called "News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code," aims to ensure Australian news companies "are fairly remunerated for the content they generate", and was brought to Parliament for consideration this week. News Corp, the largest owner of newspapers in Australia, signed a three-year partnership with Google Wednesday to sell news products for Google's curated news platform. News Corp's publications include The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, MarketWatch and the New York Post; it will provide curated news from these sites “in return for significant payments by Google.” The deal is one of many reached between Google and Australian news publishers in response to the proposal. Rather than negotiate with news publishers, Facebook said on Wednesday it will prevent people inside Australia from accessing news stories, and Facebook users elsewhere will not be able to view or share news stories from Australian outlets. Separately, Microsoft encouraged the U.S. to replicate the proposed legislation, saying that tech companies should be obligated to support a free press. Outlets across the political spectrum analyzed the proposal and what it could mean for the U.S. Coverage on all sides noted that Australia's legislation would serve as a test for other countries looking to regulate the power of big tech companies and to provide a boost for news companies that have lost significant amounts of advertising to Facebook and Google.
TITLE=> Biden Reportedly Turns Down Interview Request From Chris Wallace. ARTICLE=> Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has reportedly rejected an interview request from television journalist Chris Wallace. Wallace, a Fox News anchor, is generally known as one of the network's lone centrists. Wallace, who                                           interviewed President Donald Trump last week, argues that Biden has not faced enough necessary scrutiny from the media. Biden's reported hesitance to be interviewed by Wallace has only been covered by one left-rated outlet as of Tuesday afternoon. Many right-rated voices are critical of other media for not questioning Biden more, accusing journalists of allowing political activism and favor for one presidential candidate to compromise the integrity of their work. Coverage from some right-rated outlets also framed Biden as incompetent and unfit to be interviewed. AllSides has Wallace rated as Center; he is a registered Democrat.

Most reporting, regardless of political leaning, concentrated on Trudeau's apparent failure to specify how many times he's darkened his face with makeup.
TITLE=> Federal Court Dismisses Facebook Antitrust Lawsuits. ARTICLE=> On Monday, a federal court dismissed antitrust lawsuits against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and more than 40 states. Judge James E. Boasberg dismissed the states' lawsuit, which claimed Facebook had an unfair monopoly and said it should sell popular applications Instagram and WhatsApp, because too much time had passed since Facebook bought the companies in 2012 and 2014. Boasberg wrote separately that the FTC's suit did not present enough facts to support that Facebook had a monopoly on the social networking industry. Boasberg gave the FTC 30 days to refile its complaint.  Outlets from across the political spectrum covered the story; some highlighted the spike in Facebook's stock after the decision, while some left-rated outlets featured quotes from Big Tech critics such as Sen. Josh Hawley and members of the American Economic Liberties Project.
TITLE=> British PM Boris Johnson Remains In Intensive Care. ARTICLE=> United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson (C) is battling the COVID-19 coronavirus and remains in the intensive care unit.

TITLE=> Pelosi Announces Bill to Create 25th Amendment Commission. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin announced new legislation on Friday to establish a permanent "Commission on Presidential Capacity" under the 25th Amendment. The 25th Amendment allows for congress to transfer power to the vice president if the president is deemed “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Pelosi hinted at the announcement in a press conference the day before, saying President Donald Trump appeared to be “in an altered state” due to his COVID-19 treatment. The bill would have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate and be signed by President Trump in order to become law. Coverage in outlets on all sides said the bill is highly unlikely to pass. Some coverage in right-rated outlets noted that after Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker Pelosi is next in the line of succession. Some coverage in left-rated outlets took Pelosi’s stated concern at face value, reporting that she was “alarmed.”

TITLE=> SCOTUS Punts Decision on Oregon Wedding Cake Case. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court of the United States sent a familiar case back to the lower courts on Monday. The new case involved a Christian baker from Oregon who refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple. The case was sent back to the lower courts for reconsideration based on the precedent set by Masterpiece Bakery v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The Colorado case was decided last summer, 7-2, with Ginsberg and Sotomayor dissenting. The bakers in both Colorado and Oregon argued that their cakes are part of their artistic expression and are thus protected by the First Amendment. They further argued that their freedom of religion protects their right to run their private business the way they wish to. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the broader intersection of religious freedom and same-sex discrimination.
TITLE=> Biden Signs Executive Order Establishing Gender Policy Council. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden signed two executive orders Monday: one establishing the White House Gender Policy Council, and another moving to ensure that students are "guaranteed education free from sexual violence."

TITLE=> Jobless Claims Fall; More Republican States Cut $300 Benefits. ARTICLE=> Applications for state unemployment insurance fell last week to a pandemic low of 444,000, signaling improvement in the job market as remaining business restrictions are lifted. More than three-quarters of Republican-led states plan to end an extra $300-a-week in federal jobless benefits early, likely triggering a decrease in the number of those receiving the benefits in the months ahead.  The Biden administration is reportedly working to devise a way to keep paying heightened unemployment benefits; two anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post said "Labor Department officials have come to believe that the government cannot legally force states to administer these benefits."
TITLE=> Group Proposes California Secession. ARTICLE=> A group of right-leaning Californians proposed that part of the state secede and become "New California", composed primarily of rural areas.

TITLE=> Trump Encourages Voting by Mail in Florida. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, President Donald Trump encouraged Floridians to use the state’s vote-by-mail system, asserting that the system was “cleaned up” since “we defeated Democrats attempts at change.” This comes as the Trump campaign and others sue Nevada for a recently passed bill sending mail-in ballots to all active registered voters in Nevada. Trump defended this discrepancy, pointing to differences in each state’s election infrastructure. Coverage of the statement was mixed on all sides. Some outlets reported only the statement; some included comparisons to Trump’s past statements against mail-in voting; and some framed headlines around these comparisons. Left- and center-rated outlets tended to lean in to these comparisons, with some outlets painting Trump’s statement on Florida as a “backtrack” or “reversal.”
TITLE=> Trump Heads to US-Mexico Border in Texas. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, former President Donald Trump will go to McAllen, Texas with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and a group of congressional Republicans to tour an unfinished part of the border wall and to hold a town hall event with supporters. Trump is expected to renew his attacks on President Joe Biden's immigration policies as the rise in migrants attempting to enter the U.S. at the southern border continues. Since taking office, Biden has reversed many of Trump's immigration policies.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Rules States Can Legalize Sports Betting. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that states can legalize sports betting.

TITLE=> Donald Trump Jr.'s New Book Stirs Controversy Online. ARTICLE=> Donald Trump Jr.'s new book, "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," is garnering mixed reviews online after a November release this week. The Guardian, in the first official review of the book, called it "a better campaign biography than most," offering a "less impulsive and younger version of the incumbent." Others have criticized parts of Trump's narrative, including a scene in which he describes the "sacrifice" his family has made during a trip to Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Billed as an expose of "all the tricks that the left uses to smear conservatives and push them out of the public square," Triggered is Trump Jr.'s first book.
TITLE=> Trump Impeachment Defense to Present Arguments Friday. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump's legal team will present its defense Friday in Trump's impeachment trial. Trump is charged with inciting insurrection leading to the deadly U.S. Capitol breach on Jan. 6. The lawyers are expected to take three to four hours to make their case beginning around noon ET; they're likely to argue that Trump's speech and actions are First Amendment-protected, and that there's not enough evidence to conclude that Trump incited the breach. House impeachment managers — a team of nine Democrats acting as prosecutors in the trial — spent Wednesday and Thursday presenting senators with evidence to support the case for Trump's conviction, including graphic video of the Capitol violence. A final vote on impeachment could happen as soon as Saturday. A conviction would require 67 Senate votes; senators voted 56-44 earlier this week to proceed with the trial. Coverage from all sides continued to frame a conviction as unlikely, and focused on predicting how Trump's defense would play out. Some reports from right-rated sources projected that Trump's defense would move to frame Democrats as hypocritical by pointing out past examples of Democrat leaders using incendiary rhetoric.
TITLE=> US to Ease Restrictions, Require COVID-19 Vaccine for International Travelers. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration announced Monday that international travelers will be required to have proof of COVID-19 vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country starting in early November. Nonessential air travel to the U.S. had been banned from several major European countries, Iran and China for most of the pandemic. White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Monday the rules will "protect Americans here at home, and enhance the safety of the international air travel system." Unvaccinated U.S. citizens will need to be tested for COVID-19 within a day before returning to the U.S. and again after they arrive home. The new rules do not affect land travel from Mexico or Canada, where bans on nonessential travel are still in effect. 	The news made headlines across the spectrum Monday. Some coverage from right-rated sources placed more emphasis on the vaccine requirement; some coverage from left-rated outlets focused on the relaxed restrictions for vaccinated people.
TITLE=> Trump Suspended From Facebook, Instagram for 2 Years. ARTICLE=> Facebook announced Friday that former President Donald Trump's accounts would be suspended for two years, "effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year." After two years, Facebook "will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded." The company suspended Trump indefinitely "following his praise for people engaged" in the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6; last month, Facebook's new Oversight Board upheld the suspension but criticized its indefinite nature. Politico (lean Left bias) reported that Trump reacted to Friday's ruling, calling it "an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election." 	Trump's Facebook suspension and the company's handling of it, especially the Oversight Board, have remained in the news since January. Some reports from left-rated sources highlighted activists who criticized the less severe punishment. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on Trump's reaction to the announcement.

Biden ultimately received 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232 electoral votes. The electoral votes are expected to be confirmed at a special joint session of Congress on Jan. 6. In an address on Monday night, Biden said “it is time to turn the page” on the election, and praised election officials who "stood up for the integrity of the voting system." White House adviser Stephen Miller told Fox and Friends that Trump would still take legal action to dispute election results through "an alternate slate of electors in the contested states" to vote and send results to Congress. Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets tended to highlight Biden's speech, as well as Trump's legal challenges since the election. Right-rated outlets also tended to highlight Trump's lawsuits; some voices from the right also provided speculation about how the Trump team might challenge election results in the weeks leading up to Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20.

TITLE=> Consumer Prices Rise 4.2% in Largest Yearly Increase Since 2008. ARTICLE=> The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index, which economists use to measure inflation, rose 0.8% in April and 0.6% in March, marking a 4.2% 12-month increase. This was the largest monthly increase since 2009 and the largest yearly increase since 2008, when prices rose 4.9% year-over-year. While the CPI measures prices for a common “basket of goods,” not all prices rose equally; used car and truck prices rose 10% in the month of April alone, accounting for a third of the overall monthly increase. Additionally, food prices rose 2.4% and energy prices rose 25.1% over the last 12 months. Part of the April 2021 yearly increase came from unusually low inflation in early 2020, which saw the largest monthly decrease since 2008. Federal Reserve officials said as recently as Tuesday that they expected prices to rise temporarily and then slow down once supply chains recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.  Coverage was most prominent in business-focused outlets, with coverage from across the spectrum reporting similarly on the data and the context behind it. Coverage from some right-rated outlets focused more on the Biden administration, attributing the price increase to the “Biden economy.”
TITLE=> Pentagon Calls Kabul Drone Strike That Killed 10 Civilians A 'Tragic Mistake'. ARTICLE=> The Pentagon acknowledged the U.S. drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan on Aug. 29 as a "tragic mistake." U.S. Marines Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, confirmed on Friday that the airstrike killed seven children and three adults, none of whom had known ties to ISIS-K. The strike was arranged based on intelligence that suggested two “high profile” Islamic State militants were planning another attack on the airport in Kabul amid evacuations. Central Command officials observed what they believed were explosives being loaded into a car, which turned out to be containers of water. The news was prominently covered across the spectrum. Some outlets linked back to previous reports that suggested there was no ISIS bomb, highlighting how Central Command officials didn't change their "original narrative." Coverage from right-rated outlets oftenb framed President Joe Biden and military leadership in a negative light, with some accusing them of war crimes.
