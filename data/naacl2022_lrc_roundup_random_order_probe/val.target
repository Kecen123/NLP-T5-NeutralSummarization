TITLE=> Trump Signs $2.2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill into law Friday afternoon, aimed at stabilizing the economy and American life amid the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. The legislation — the largest of its kind in U.S. history — includes direct payments to individuals, increased unemployment benefits, and bailouts for small business and corporations. An effort from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) to force a roll call vote Friday failed; Trump called for Massie to be kicked out of the Republican party for purportedly trying to hold up the legislation.

TITLE=> Bush Spokesperson Calls NYT Reporting False; Former President Supposedly Undecided. ARTICLE=> According to reporting by the New York Times, former President George W. Bush (R-TX) won't support president Donald Trump's 2020 re-election bid, following suit with several high profile Republicans including former National Security Advisor Colin Powell and Sen. Mitt Romney (UT). However, a Bush spokesperson called the reporting false, saying the former president is unsure how he'll vote come November. Reporting from across the spectrum continuously referred to the Times story; right-rated outlets largely focused on the spokesperson's statement whereas left-rated outlets focused on Bush's supposed indecisiveness.

TITLE=> US Envoy to Haiti Resigns Over Migrant Deportations. ARTICLE=> U.S. Special Envoy for Haiti Daniel Foote resigned Thursday to protest what he called “inhumane” deportations of asylum-seeking Haitian migrants to Haiti. Many of the migrants in question did not come directly from Haiti, but instead lived in Central and South American countries for years before coming to the U.S. Additionally, Haiti is recovering from a devastating August earthquake that killed 2,200 people and impacted 800,000. In his resignation letter, Foote said: “I will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs to daily life.” State Department spokesman Ned Price criticized Foote, who was appointed in late July 2021, saying he had “resigned and mischaracterized” the situation instead of “participating in a solutions-oriented policy process.” Coverage was prominently featured across the spectrum on Thursday. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides, with a few exceptions; while most headlines called Foote a “U.S.” diplomat, for instance, Fox News’ headline said he was “Biden's.” Some left-rated outlets like CNN framed the resignation as a protest of “U.S. policy” on an issue the Biden administration was “grappling with.”
TITLE=> Iran Acknowledges 'Unintentionally' Shooting Down Ukrainian Jet. ARTICLE=> After first denying involvement in the Ukrainian Flight 752 crash that killed 176 passengers and crew, Iranian officials took responsibility for the event on Saturday, admitting that the country's Revolutionary Guard "unintentionally" shot down the plane after mistaking it for a hostile cruise missile. In a state TV broadcast, President Hassan Rouhani confirmed earlier suspicions about the cause of the crash, describing it as an "unforgivable mistake." Outlets on both the left and right highlighted Iranian officials' earlier denial of the country's involvement, as well as responses from leaders in Canada and the U.S.

TITLE=> Calls Mount for Joe Biden to Choose a Woman of Color for VP. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden is facing pressure from some circles to select a woman of color as his 2020 running mate after Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar removed herself from consideration Thursday. “I think this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket,” Klobuchar said in an MSNBC interview. Many voices from all sides of the political spectrum noted that choosing a woman of color as a vice presidential candidate could potentially help Biden secure support among voters of color and young voters. Some right-rated outlets noted that while the Black Lives Matter movement may have decreased Klobuchar's own chances of getting the vice presidential nomination, Klobuchar's decision and statement likely further diminished the chances of other white women like Senators Elizabeth Warren (MA) and Tammy Baldwin (WI), and Minnesota Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
TITLE=> Retail Sales Drop by Record 16.4 Percent. ARTICLE=> Consumers spent a record 16.4% less on retail shopping in April, as businesses remained closed and potential shoppers stayed home amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak's impact on the business sector, specifically smaller and more customer-reliant businesses, has been a point of concern, as some entities may not recover from such significant financial disruption. The drop was higher than the roughly 12.5% decline many experts were reportedly predicting. Many reports focused on the potential long-term implications the economic lockdown will have on businesses post-pandemic. Conversely, some concentrated on cellphone tracking data that suggests retail traffic has risen since May began, as certain areas begin to relax restrictions.
TITLE=> University of Alabama Board of Trustees Vote to Refund $26.5 Million Donation. ARTICLE=> On Friday morning, the University of Alabama Board of Trustees voted to refund a $26.5 million donation to one of its largest donors. Hugh Culverhouse Jr., one of Alabama's largest donors, and the law school's namesake, decried Alabama's new restrictive abortion ban in a press release and urged students to boycott. The University took action to return the donation and remove Culverhouse's name from the law school; The Board of Trustees said that they refunded his donation due to his demands of how the money should be used. Culverhouse believes that said refund and removal of his name is to punish him for his comments.
TITLE=> Will Ellison be DNC Chair?. ARTICLE=> After Howard Dean dropped out of consideration, Keith Ellison might become DNC chair, but many stories are circulating about his beliefs and abilities.
TITLE=> Pandemic Unemployment Benefits Expire For 7.5 Million Americans. ARTICLE=> About 7.5 million jobless Americans lost their COVID-19 pandemic-era unemployment boost of $300 per week on Labor Day — a holiday that has solicited different interpretations from across the spectrum. The jobless were initially granted $600 a week from April to July 2020, but Congress and the Trump administration reduced the payment to $300 when reviving the program in December. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are currently a record number of job openings, though hiring shortages persist across some industries; some research suggests that unemployed people who lose benefits might have a harder time finding a job. If the Biden administration's $3.5 trillion federal budget plan is passed, many social safety net programs would likely be expanded. Center- and left-rated sources covered the news more prominently, many of which framed the cutoff as harmful for the unemployed and described it as the "most abrupt" end to government aid in U.S. history. Some also pointed out how the Biden administration said states can redirect other federal funds to extend jobless benefits, yet no states have taken action to do so. Left-rated voices often took the stance that the act will "reduce spending" and "increase poverty," while highlighting families who were "left scrambling" and "remain vulnerable." Right-rated voices were more likely to see the termination of the pandemic unemployment benefits as a win for small businesses, and argued that purportedly lucrative payments caused people to stay home rather than getting a job.
TITLE=> House Dems, White House Clear Path to Pass USMCA. ARTICLE=> House Democrats and the White House have struck a tentative deal to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The pact will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), completing one of President Trump's core campaign promises.

TITLE=> When Will States Finish Counting Presidential Votes?. ARTICLE=> Votes cast in the 2020 presidential election might not be fully counted until later this week. The Supreme Court and state courts handed down multiple rulings last week in regards to ballot deadlines; SCOTUS set extended deadlines for vote-counting in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, while a Minnesota state court decided that votes had to be tallied by Tuesday. President Donald Trump previously called for all ballots to be counted by Tuesday, and said early Wednesday that "as far as I'm concerned, we've already won," despite the winner not yet being clear; a campaign lawyer for Joe Biden made a similarly premature claim about the former vice president Wednesday. Coverage from many left- and center-rated sources focused on Trump's premature declaration of victory, and criticized his purported attempts to undermine the vote counting process by suggesting widespread fraud. Reports from right-rated sources are generally focused on examining why counts are taking longer than usual; which candidate the extended counts may favor; and how, if at all, the extended deadlines could be linked to voter fraud.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Responding to Civil Unrest with Military Mobilization. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump is mulling over whether or not to send in federal troops in response to widespread unrest and public outrage following George Floyd's death in police custody last week. A report published Friday morning indicated the president may be backing away from his initial plan to invoke the military. Many left-rated voices argued that the president desires armed conflict, and urged the public to challenge his purportedly authoritarian rhetoric. Right-rated voices offered fewer opinions; some advocated the need for law and order while questioning the necessity of calling in federal troops, and others explored the history of U.S. presidents calling on the military in times of crisis.
TITLE=> Secretary of State Pompeo Meets with North Korea. ARTICLE=> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spent the last two days in talks with North Korean leaders on a number of issues, including setting a timeline for the the country's denuclearization. The secretary said Saturday that they had made progress in the talks, but North Korean media released a statement saying the talks were "regrettable."

TITLE=> Perspectives: Schools, Families Face Challenging Return to the Classroom. ARTICLE=> As students and faculty return to schools, concerns about COVID-19, mask mandates and the pandemic's psychological impact on children are major points of discussion. Fifteen states and Puerto Rico have enacted mask mandates for schools; eight states have outlawed school mask mandates, though some school districts in those states have mandated masks anyway. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, child COVID-19 cases have increased four-fold over the past month, from roughly 38,000 cases per week at the end of July to 180,000 this past week. Healthy children are unlikely to suffer serious complications from COVID-19, and are far less likely to die from COVID-19 than other age groups. 	Left-rated voices have often focused more on safety concerns for students and faculty, framed in the context of the COVID-19 Delta variant and a rising number of children who've contracted COVID-19. Right-rated voices often concentrated on inconsistent or purportedly overbearing COVID-19 guidance from schools, teachers' unions and public health officials; many called for an end to mandating masks for young students, citing data that suggests COVID-19 transmission rates in schools are typically much lower than rates in the surrounding communities. Opinions from across the spectrum have also highlighted remote learning's negative impacts on kids, and how the coming school year may be instrumental in restoring normality for young students.

TITLE=> FDA Approves First Alzheimer’s Drug In Nearly 20 Years Despite Efficacy Concerns. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a drug to treat patients with Alzheimer’s disease for the first time since 2003. Some experts have voiced concerns over conflicting evidence of the drug’s effectiveness, which prompted the FDA’s independent advisory committee to oppose approval in November 2020. Biogen, the drug’s developer, will be required to conduct a post-approval confirmatory trial to verify the drug's cognitive benefits. The drug, named aducanumab and branded Aduhelm, could be pulled from the market if no benefits are found. Coverage was more widespread in center- and left-rated outlets as of Monday afternoon. Some coverage from across the spectrum focused on the efficacy debate, with other coverage focusing on the 20-year gap.

TITLE=> Kentucky AG Releases Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Recordings. ARTICLE=> On Friday, the Kentucky attorney general’s office released 15 hours of audio from the grand jury proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case. The grand jury had decided the previous week not to charge the two officers who shot Taylor and to charge another officer with wanton endangerment for firing into a neighboring apartment. In the recordings, the officers testified that they had knocked and announced themselves multiple times; Kenneth Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend, maintained that he and Taylor did not know who knocked when police forced the door open, prompting Walker to fire his gun. Among other things, the recordings also reveal that Louisville police did not have an official plan for raiding Taylor’s apartment other than a list on a whiteboard. Outlets on all sides featured reporting on the audio, with some outlets posting multiple news articles on the story and specific witness statements. Few major trends distinguished between coverage in left- and right-rated outlets.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Says Arizona Voting Laws are Legal. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court said Thursday that Arizona laws banning ballot harvesting and out-of-precinct voting are legal and do not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA). The vote was 6-3 along ideological lines; Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, saying the requirements "don't exceed the 'usual burdens of voting.'" Justice Elena Kagan wrote the dissent, saying the Voting Rights Act "should not be diminished by this Court." The decision reversed a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that said Arizona's laws violate the VRA by resulting in racial discrimination. The debate over election integrity and voting rights remains a core political theme; the Justice Department recently sued Georgia over its voting laws, saying they restrict the black vote. 	Coverage differed significantly between left- and right-rated sources. Coverage from the left typically framed the laws as restrictive and discriminatory, and highlighted concerns about the ability of minorities to take up legal challenge against voting laws in the future. Reports from the right often framed the laws as justified and highlighted Alito's opinion on why the laws don't violate the VRA. 
TITLE=> Trump Says Treasury Should Get A Cut From TikTok Sale.

TITLE=> White House Rules Out Involvement In 'Vaccine Passports'. ARTICLE=> White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the Biden administration will not be supporting a "vaccine passport" system that requires Americans to carry a credential. "There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential," Psaki said. She added that that the decision to employ vaccination credentials would be left to nongovernmental entities in private and nonprofit sectors. Some states such as New York, however, are establishing a digital app people can use to offer proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or recent negative test. Florida and Texas governors recently issued executive orders prohibiting state and local governments from issuing vaccination credentials; the orders also prohibit businesses that receive state funding from requiring proof of vaccination. Coverage from outlets across the political spectrum tended to highlight pushback from Republican lawmakers and states; some left-rated outlets also highlighted the U.K.'s ongoing debate surrounding a COVID-19 "passport" initiative.
TITLE=> Perspectives: First Night of 2020 Democratic National Convention.

The announcement comes two days after Schumer told reporters that Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who leads the bipartisan group writing the bill, said they would “have legislation ready by Friday.” Schumer will file cloture on a placeholder bill on Monday, setting up a Wednesday vote that could end formal debate on the bill if 60 senators, including at least 10 Republicans, approve. Democrats hope to pair this infrastructure package with a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill, which would keep Republicans from using the filibuster to require a 60-vote threshold.  Coverage was more common in left- and center-rated outlets as of Thursday afternoon. Coverage was mostly balanced across the spectrum, with some outlets calling Schumer's actions a "hardball strategy."

The tension has been a focus of media coverage on all sides of the political spectrum, with voices from both left and right criticizing China for various reasons. Right-rated outlets and voices focused more on the alleged genocide taking place in Xinjiang, where Uighurs are reportedly in "political re-education" programs that have been likened to WWII-era labor and concentration camps.

ARTICLE=> A White House memo leaked over the weekend details occasions in which Dr. Anthony Fauci has apparently been incorrect or contradictory in his public statements about the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. President Donald Trump and other White House officials have been publicly critical of Fauci's guidance in recent weeks. Coverage from right-rated outlets was more likely to frame Fauci as responsible for purportedly unnecessary lockdown measures. Coverage from left-rated outlets generally painted the memo's release as a White House attempt to undermine Fauci's credibility, while referencing the times Trump and other public officials have made incorrect predictions and forecasts about the virus.

Anwar was taken to the hospital, but did not survive; the two girls were pulled from the wreck and arrested at the scene. The carjacking received coverage from outlets across the political spectrum. Media outlets on all sides of the spectrum mentioned that Anwar was a Pakistani-American. However, outlets across the spectrum did not mention the races of the perpetrators, causing many on social media to compare coverage of the carjacking to coverage of the Atlanta shooting earlier this month, in which six Asian American women were killed. Some voices said the fact that media outlets are inconsistent in mentioning race when covering violence demonstrates bias.
TITLE=> Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Is Safe and Effective, FDA Analysis Finds. ARTICLE=> The single-shot COVID-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Biotech is safe and effective, according to an FDA briefing document released Wednesday. The news comes two days before a panel of outside advisers meets to determine whether to grant an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allowing distribution of the vaccine. Furthermore, the Biden Administration announced Wednesday it would distribute 3 to 4 million doses of J&J’s vaccine to states as early as next week. Johnson & Johnson is contracted to deliver 100 million doses to the U.S. by the end of June. Left- and center-rated outlets featured the story more prominently than right-rated outlets. Coverage followed similar narratives across the spectrum, with most highlighting the vaccine's projected rate of effectiveness.

The other leaders of the campaign — Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea — were also charged. Bannon’s arrest and indictment was covered by outlets on all sides. Coverage generally included President Donald Trump’s reaction to the indictment and Bannon’s history with the Trump campaign.

TITLE=> Uncertainty Surrounds Schools for the Fall; Pediatricians Recommend Reopening. ARTICLE=> How to reopen schools this fall remains one of the biggest questions about safely returning to a state of normalcy in the face of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Many reports on all sides of the media spectrum, particularly on the right, focused on the American Academy of Pediatricians' recommendation that schools prioritize finding a way to hold in-person classes this fall. Some concentrated on feature profiles of students and how they've managed education amid social distancing; others looked closely at the ways in-person classes could be complicated and present purported risk.

Her emergence has been the focus of media coverage and analysis from throughout the political spectrum. Some reports from left-rated sources concentrated on criticisms of Barrett's stances on LGBTQ issues and women's rights. Coverage from right-rated sources is more concentrated on praise of Barrett's judicial record and religious stances. Many right-rated outlets reported on a Newsweek article which connects the People of Praise, a religious group of which Barrett a member, to The Handmaid's Tale, a TV show about an anti-women dystopia. Many other reports on all sides focused on Circuit Court Judge Barbara Lagoa, who is also considered a frontrunner.

While he has been condemned on both sides for hypocritically supporting the #MeToo movement, many on the Right also feel that Democrats enabled his actions in order to keep him at the forefront of liberal causes.

TITLE=> U.S. Economy Grew at a Record 33.1% Annual Rate in Third Quarter. ARTICLE=> The U.S. economy experienced record growth in the third quarter as the gross domestic product (GDP) rebounded at a 33.1% annualized rate.

TITLE=> Israel and UAE Normalize Relations in US-Brokered Deal. ARTICLE=> With the help of the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have reached an agreement to normalize relations, President Donald Trump announced Thursday. The agreement includes a promise that Israel will “suspend declaring sovereignty” over occupied West Bank territory. Delegates from the two countries will meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements on energy, security, and other issues. News outlets on all sides covered the announcement and statements made by each country's leaders. Some coverage from right-rated outlets emphasized the deal’s “historic” nature. Some coverage from left-rated outlets discussed complications with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
TITLE=> Biden, Trump Release Staff Diversity Data. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden's presidential campaign released its diversity data Saturday after facing pressure in a town hall discussion on issues affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. 35 percent of his full-time staff are people of color, and 53 percent are female. People of color reportedly make up 25 percent of President Donald Trump's senior reelection campaign staff, and women make up 56 percent. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum compared Biden's diversity numbers to the Trump campaign's numbers. Coverage from both the right and left focused on the specific percentage as well; some headlines from right-rated outlets included "only 35 percent," and some coverage from left-rated outlets highlighted calls for greater diversity in Biden's staff.
TITLE=> Supreme Court Dismisses Obamacare Challenge, Leaves Law Intact. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court rejected the latest GOP attempt to challenge the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, ruling 7-2 that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the law. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, arguing that the plaintiffs could not bring their case to federal court because they had not shown any harm "fairly traceable" to Obamacare’s individual mandate, which Republicans lowered to $0 in 2017. Obamacare was still expected to survive beyond the question of standing, thanks to the opinions of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh that the individual mandate could be "severed" from the rest of the law. The court’s ruling leaves the entire law intact, including the individual mandate. Center- and left-rated outlets tended to feature this story prominently on homepages; right-rated outlets tended to feature another Supreme Court ruling, which sided with a Catholic adoption agency that excluded same-sex couples for religious reasons. 
TITLE=> President Trump Asks Supreme Court to Block Release of His Tax Returns. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's legal team petitioned the Supreme Court Thursday to keep the president's tax returns confidential. If the court accepts the case, it will be the first time a president's personal finances will be involved in Supreme Court proceedings, and could set a new precedent for presidential immunity.
TITLE=> Florida Gov. DeSantis Signs Law Limiting Mail-In Ballots and Drop Boxes. ARTICLE=> Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law Thursday morning that places tighter limits on ballot drop boxes and voting by mail. "I have what we think is the strongest election integrity measures in the country," DeSantis said. The law, which bears some similarities to Georgia’s recent controversial voting law, was passed by Florida Republicans on near party-line votes and over the opposition of Florida’s county supervisors of elections. Specifically, the law requires an ID number to request a mail-in ballot, lowers the applicability of mail-in ballot requests from 4 years to 2, and limits drop boxes to in-person monitored locations during regular early voting hours, among other things. DeSantis, accompanied by the pro-Trump group Club 45 USA, signed the law live on Fox News and shut out local media. Democrats and civil rights groups promptly filed two lawsuits challenging the new law.  Coverage from the left was more likely to use the words “suppress” and “restrict.” Coverage was less prominent in right-rated outlets outside of Fox News.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Eric Adams. ARTICLE=> Brooklyn Borough President and former police captain Eric Adams won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City on Wednesday. Declaring himself as “the new face of the Democratic Party,” Adams has appealed to centric, working-class voters and promoted a balance between "fighting crime and ending racial injustice in policing." Many outlets across the political spectrum are claiming that Adams' political vision for New York City still remains unclear. Some left-rated voices described Adams as someone with "more alignments than plans"; some right-rated voices labeled the potential future mayor as "a somewhat confounding politician." Center-leaning outlets mostly avoided this political discourse, instead highlighting his current plans to bolster affordable housing, public transit and racial equality. 
TITLE=> Wuhan Death Toll Raised by 50% as China Admits Mistakes. ARTICLE=> Chinese officials raised the official death toll in the city of Wuhan — where the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic first began — by over 50% Friday morning, adding nearly 1,300 fatalities to bring the city's total to 3,869. Officials said some deaths were "mistakenly reported," while others, such as deaths that occurred outside of hospitals, had been completely missed in some cases. The confusion led China to again deny accusations that it has masked the true toll of its outbreak. Reporting outlets located throughout the political spectrum, particularly right-rated sources, framed the revision as another mark against China's handling of the pandemic and more purported evidence that Chinese officials may have instituted a wide-scale cover-up.
TITLE=> Rand Paul Pushes For Whistleblower Identity to be Revealed. ARTICLE=> Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) is pushing to reveal the identity of the Ukraine whistleblower as part of the Senate impeachment trial. Paul reportedly attempted to pose a question about the individual multiple times during proceedings in recent days; Chief Justice John Roberts has reportedly blocked Paul's efforts. Most reporting outlets addressed the fact that "conservative" news sources had purported to name the whistleblower.
TITLE=> Wisconsin to Hold Primary Election Tuesday. ARTICLE=> Wisconsin will hold in-person voting for its primary election on Tuesday, following wide-scale debate that led to the state's Supreme Court blocking Gov. Tony Evers' Monday motion to postpone the election. The decision comes after Wisconsin Republicans and the Republican National Committee asked the Supreme Court to freeze the extension of the state's absentee ballot deadline. Many health experts, a number of Wisconsin public officials and voting rights advocates have encouraged residents not to go to the polls. Updated April 6 at 6:51 p.m.
TITLE=> Man Surrenders Peacefully After Bomb Threat Near Library of Congress. ARTICLE=> A man who claimed to have a bomb in his pickup truck near the Library of Congress Thursday surrendered to police after several hours of negotiations. The U.S. Capitol Police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) responded to the threat near the library in Washington D.C. Thursday. Police say a suspect identified as Floyd Ray Roseberry parked in front of the library's Thomas Jefferson Building Thursday morning and told police he had a bomb; Roseberry apparently posted live videos from inside the truck to his Facebook page. Police say the suspect's motives remain unclear, and that he made anti-government statements. Both chambers of Congress are in recess, so few people were at the Capitol complex Thursday. Any individuals in the library and three nearby office buildings were evacuated . 	Outlets on all sides of the media spectrum are covering this story prominently. Left- and center-rated sources sometimes mentioned that Washington D.C. police have been on high alert since the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
TITLE=> Trump Leads Biden In Latino Voters In Florida. ARTICLE=> An NBC News/Marist poll released Tuesday showed President Donald Trump leading Joe Biden among Latinos 50% to 46% in the key battleground state of Florida. Trump and Biden tied at 48% among Florida voters overall. A Miami-Dade county poll put Trump at a slight lead with Latino voters as well, though the result fell within the margin of error. Other polls suggest Biden is still leading Trump in six swing states by an average of four points. Coverage from center- and left-rated outlets tended to frame the story as a warning for Democrats. Coverage from both left- and right-rated outlets highlighted the fact that Biden's support among Latino voters is well behind Hillary Clinton's exit numbers in the 2016 election.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Netanyahu Ousted as Israel's Prime Minister. ARTICLE=> Israel’s parliament voted in a new coalition government on Sunday, ousting former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after 12 years under his leadership. Netanyahu was replaced by Naftali Bennett, a former tech entrepreneur and Netanyahu aide who is considered more right-leaning than his predecessor. Bennett is expected to focus on domestic issues before he cedes power in two years to Yair Lapid, a centrist who was appointed by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in May to organize the new coalition. Netanyahu gave his final speech on Monday, vowing to return to power and criticizing the Biden administration’s attempt to revive the Iran nuclear deal.  Voices in right-rated outlets tended to speak more favorably of Netanyahu, with one writer calling him “transformative.” Voices in left-rated outlets tended to be more critical, describing Netanyahu as “polarizing” and even “unhinged.” Voices on all sides agreed on Netanyahu's significance but disagreed on whether the new coalition government would succeed. 
TITLE=> Tillerson Likely for State. ARTICLE=> Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is Donald Trump's likely pick for Secretary of State after many other people have been considered and interviewed.
TITLE=> Democrats in Congress Call for Trump Removal Under 25th Amendment. ARTICLE=> Several Democrats and at least one Republican in Congress have called on Vice President Mike Pence to remove President Donald Trump from office under the 25th Amendment, after hundreds of Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday. The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to remove a president if he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Some Democratic House members have also announced their support for articles of impeachment if the 25th Amendment is not invoked. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a statement blaming demonstrators and inadequate security for the Capitol breach, making no mention of Trump. Coverage across the spectrum focused on high-profile figures like Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to say that Trump incited the breach of the Capitol building.
TITLE=> Courting the Hispanic Vote. ARTICLE=> As President Trump courts Hispanic voters, a Marist/NBC poll shows Trump narrowly ahead of Joe Biden among Hispanics in Florida. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign is building a significant Latino outreach program, spurred on by warnings from Latino groups that lackluster efforts to win their support could hurt him in November.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Texas Holding Facility for Immigrant Teens Reopens. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden's administration reopened a Texas holding facility this week for unauthorized immigrant teenagers who cross the Mexico-U.S. border without a parent. The shelter was opened in July 2019 and closed roughly a month later. News of its reopening drew comparisons between Biden and former President Donald Trump on immigration policy at the border. Voices from the right, especially on social media, criticized media coverage of the reopening as too lenient compared to the "kids in cages" mantra that often appeared in coverage of the Trump administration's policies for detaining unauthorized immigrant families. Some on the left dismissed these criticisms, usually by citing the fact that this specific reopening doesn't involve U.S. border officials separating children from their parents.
TITLE=> US Corporations Pause Political Donations After Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> Several U.S. corporations suspended their campaign contributions following Wednesday’s breach of the U.S. Capitol building by pro-Trump extremists. Charles Schwab, Citigroup, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Microsoft have halted all political contributions to both Republicans and Democrats. American Express, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Commerce Bank, Dow Chemical, Morgan Stanley and Marriott International each stopped their contributions specifically to members of Congress who they say “impeded the peaceful transfer of power” by opposing the certification of President-elect Joe Biden. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to link President Donald Trump to the Capitol breach. Center- and right-rated outlets referred to the Capitol breach with a variation of “last week's attack on the Capitol.”
TITLE=> Death of George Floyd Raises Questions About Police Brutality, Racism. ARTICLE=> The death of a Minneapolis man Monday following an incident with law enforcement rekindled tension and raised questions about police brutality and racism in policing. 46-year-old George Floyd, a black man, is seen on video repeatedly telling officers that he could not breathe as an officer pinned Floyd's neck to the ground with his knee. Floyd died later Monday night at a nearby medical center; it's unclear exactly what happened before and after the video was taken. All four officers involved have been fired, but no criminal charges have been filed as of Wednesday afternoon. Many voices, particularly left- and center-rated, argue that Floyd's death signifies law enforcement's systemic prejudice against minorities.
TITLE=> White House Says Trump Will Sign GOP Immigration Bill. ARTICLE=> The White House said Friday evening that President Trump will support the GOP leadership's upcoming immigration bill as well as a more enforcement-heavy conservative immigration bill.

TITLE=> Nevada Prepares for Caucuses, the Third 2020 Primary. ARTICLE=> Democrats in Nevada are heading to the polls Saturday to cast their vote for their party's nominee in the third presidential primary of the 2020 election. Analysis and news coverage from outlets on both sides of the aisle highlighted what the primary means for specific candidates, among whom Bernie Sanders is forecast to win, but also for the party as a whole, which is still trying to prove itself after a messy Iowa caucus earlier this month. Republicans, on the other hand, will not be going to the polls today; the party voted to cancel its caucus last year.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said during an Instagram Live session on Monday night that "the U.S. is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is exactly what they are." The comments were quickly denounced by conservatives, who said the comparison is insensitive and demeaning to Holocaust victims. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Mark Morgan, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, and the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) condemned the representative's remarks, and a border patrol agent invited her to come visit the detention facilities.
TITLE=> HHS Secretary Tom Price Resigns. ARTICLE=> Tom Price, Trump's HHS Secretary, has been forced to resign after the story broke that he spent over 1 million dollars in taxpayer funds on private jet flights for both government work and personal travel.
TITLE=> Gov. Kemp Orders Local Georgia Officials to Abandon Mask Mandates. ARTICLE=> Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) overruled facemask mandates issued by local state governments Wednesday, reportedly opting to continue strong encouragement of mask-wearing while calling requirements "unenforceable" and "a bridge too far". Kemp's previous orders to avoid mandates were dismissed in numerous localities. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused more on Kemp's expressed commitment to promoting public health while limiting purported government overreach. Coverage from left-rated outlets focused more on criticisms of the order from several Georgia local leaders and health officials.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Canceling Cancel Culture. ARTICLE=> The toppling of statues, re-branding of companies and targeting of people who make controversial statements have fueled a nationwide debate about cancel culture, and both its purported value and problems. A letter published in Harper's Weekly and signed by over 100 artists and writers this week called for an end to cancel culture and the stifling of free thought; some signatories have since faced backlash for endorsing the message. Right-rated voices generally condemned cancel culture as a misguided overreaction to social injustice, and advocated for more overall attention on fostering free expression. Some left-rated voices argued that cancel culture does not threaten free speech, framing it more as righteous accountability for controversial thoughts and actions.
TITLE=> Clinton Makes History. ARTICLE=> Hillary Clinton made history tonight by becoming the first female candidate from a major political party.
TITLE=> Senate Democrats Agree to $3.5T Budget Reconciliation Bill. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday night, Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee agreed to a budget reconciliation bill of $3.5 trillion.  The bill would include an expansion of Medicare, climate change initiatives, and funding for racial justice programs.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Politicization of Inflation. ARTICLE=> Amid rising consumer prices and debates over large federal spending bills, the government's role in fueling or relieving Americans' economic burdens is a subject of debate. Many Republicans say current Democratic policies and high-cost spending bills will make current inflation worsen in coming years, hurting consumers, workers and families. The Federal Reserve maintains that current inflation will only be temporary, a stance that President Joe Biden and other prominent Democrats have echoed while advocating for spending packages they say will better the lives of average Americans.  Right-rated voices have covered inflation fears more prominently, with some accusing Democrats of dismissing inflation fears while supporting harmful economic policy. Left- and center-rated voices have been less accusatory, often exploring the likelihood of inflation worsening and financially-sustainable legislation being agreed upon in Congress. Some financial news outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal, published some reports that suggest inflation will be temporary, and others addressing how it may still cause significant short-term issues; others, such as CNBC (Center bias), highlighted voices who accused the Federal Reserve of being overly optimistic about inflation only being temporary.
TITLE=> Joe Rogan Discusses Vaccines and Ivermectin with CNN’s Sanjay Gupta. ARTICLE=> In a 3-hour podcast episode released Wednesday, podcast host Joe Rogan talked with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta about COVID-19 vaccines, ivermectin, and more. Rogan said CNN “outright lied” when it said he had taken “horse dewormer”; Rogan says he's taken a prescribed dose of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin, rather than the veterinary form of the drug, which some people have taken contrary to FDA warnings. Gupta replied that CNN “shouldn’t have said that.” Gupta also tried to convince Rogan to support COVID-19 vaccines for groups Rogan had previously said didn't need it; Gupta later wrote that the effort was “probably futile” because “his mind was made up.” Rogan said he had attempted to get vaccinated earlier this year but was held back by scheduling conflicts. Rogan also suggested people should “get vaccinated and then get sick” to get the best protection. After Gupta pushed back on that comment, Rogan added that it wasn’t his intention to, as Gupta put it, “recommend people get infected.” Coverage was sharply divided between left- and right-rated outlets. Left-rated outlets tended to focus on Rogan “admitting” he’d almost gotten vaccinated. Right-rated outlets tended to focus on Gupta “admitting” CNN had improperly framed his use of ivermectin. Update 10/14/21 3:01 ET: Previously stated the episode was released Thursday. The episode is dated on Wednesday, Oct. 13 on Spotify.
TITLE=> Protests Call for States, Country to Re-open. ARTICLE=> Protests broke out in several states this week, with the largest happening in Michigan, as people expressed disdain amid continued social and economic shutdowns. Many of the demonstrations were reportedly led by self-proclaimed pro-Trump conservatives. Left- and center-rated outlets were more likely to frame protesters as "far-right" groups who were ignoring social distancing recommendations and questioning the severity of the pandemic. Conversely, right-rated outlets generally painted the protests as pertaining more to economic instability and the public's desire to return to work. Many reporting outlets also focused on President Trump's apparent support for the demonstrations.
TITLE=> YouTube Bans Proud Boys Founder Gavin McInnes. ARTICLE=> YouTube has banned Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-right Proud Boys group and former CRTV host, for “third-party claims of copyright infringement.” He has already been banned from Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, and Instagram.
TITLE=> ICE to Start Raids on Sunday. ARTICLE=> Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will be conducting sweeps to locate immigrants without legal status on Sunday. The raids will target roughly 2,000 families with outstanding deportation notices across 10 major cities. Many left-leaning outlets covered news of the sweeps by reminding people of their rights and comparing the raids to actions of past oppressive governments. Some on the left dismissed the raids as a political statement. Right-leaning outlets focused on the fact that while there are roughly a million undocumented people with outstanding removal orders, only individuals with criminal histories will be targeted this weekend. Some on the right argued that the fact that raids were announced in advance may be President Trump's way of trying to bargain with Democrats.
TITLE=> Biden Expected to Nominate Antony Blinken as Secretary of State. ARTICLE=> Projected 2020 presidential election winner Joe Biden is expected to nominate Antony Blinken as Secretary of State, according to multiple sources.

TITLE=> Trump Shuts Down Blog After One Month. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump’s blog, titled “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,” has been shut down indefinitely, Trump senior aide Jason Miller announced Wednesday. Miller told CNBC that the blog, started on May 4 after the former president’s ban from Twitter and Facebook following the January 6th Capitol riot, “was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on.” This echoed Trump’s previous statement calling the blog “a temporary way of getting my thoughts and ideas out to the public without the Fake News spin.” Additionally, an anonymous Trump adviser reportedly told The Washington Post that “the former president wanted to open a new ‘platform’ and didn’t like that this platform was being mocked and had so few readers.” Right-rated outlets were less likely to cover this story and tended to focus on Miller’s comments. Some coverage from left-rated outlets highlighted the blog’s short lifespan, with some analysis coverage disparaging the blog as “whiny.”
TITLE=> 5 Lawyers Leave Trump Legal Team Ahead of Impeachment Trial. ARTICLE=> The legal team set to defend former President Donald Trump has reportedly disbanded a little more than one week before Trump's impeachment trial. South Carolina attorneys Butch Bowers, who was to lead the team, and Deborah Barbier reportedly left the legal team on Saturday. Former federal prosecutors Greg Harris, Johnny Gasser and Josh Howard also left the following day, Fox News reported; it was purportedly a mutual decision over the direction of the defense argument.​ Trump was impeached by the House on Jan. 13  for “incitement of an insurrection" after his supporters breached the Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. The impeachment trial will begin on Feb. 9. New attorneys are expected to join Trump's defense this week.​ Coverage from across the spectrum analyzed the trail's potential outcome.

Dominic Pezzola, 43, and William Pepe, 31, were charged with conspiracy, civil disorder, unlawfully entering restricted buildings or grounds, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in restricted buildings or grounds. The pair was initially charged in a criminal complaint and arrested a week after the breach; the conspiracy charges were new as of Friday.

TITLE=> J.K Rowling Faces Backlash for Supporting Woman Who Was Fired for Her Views on Transgenderism. ARTICLE=> An earlier edition of this post incorrectly referred to Maya Forstater as "Mackereth", another person also fired for similar reasons. J.K. Rowling faced backlash this week for a tweet she wrote in defense of Maya Forstater, a tax expert who was fired for tweeting "men cannot change into women." The Central London Employment Tribunal upheld her firing, with the judge stating the employer’s decision was fair because Forstater’s stance is “incompatible with human dignity” and "not worthy of respect in a democratic society." Many left media outlets reported on Rowling's tweets with condemnation, calling her "transphobic" and a "TERF" ("trans-exclusionary radical feminist"). Right-wing media outlets defended Forstater, saying her beliefs are reasonable and that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent.
TITLE=> Rick Perry Links Fossil Fuels with Decreased Sexual Assault, Draws Controversy. ARTICLE=> Rick Perry said on Thursday that the use of fossil fuels could prevent sexual assault in Africa.

Many right-rated outlets rebuked vote by mail, with some citing voting security concerns, and others criticizing prominent Democratic backers for pushing for additional ballots in non-English languages.
TITLE=> Two Autopsies Rule George Floyd Death a Homicide, but Offer Separate Reasons. ARTICLE=> An independent autopsy commissioned by George Floyd's family concluded that Floyd died of asphyxiation and suffocation, while an autopsy from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner attributed Floyd's death to a heart attack brought on by the manner of his arrest. The results of each autopsy, which were released Monday, called Floyd's death in police custody last week a homicide; Floyd died after an officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes while he was handcuffed. Some coverage from left- and center-rated outlets framed the medical examiner's report as questionable, pointing to the county coroner's initially inconclusive report on the death last week; the initial report also suggested that asphyxia and strangulation did not cause Floyd's death. Some coverage from right-rated outlets concentrated more on the coroner's official report while minimizing the privately-conducted autopsy.

TITLE=> 6 State Primaries, Including Michigan, Set for Biden-Sanders Duel. ARTICLE=> Six states, including the perennial swing state of Michigan, hold primary elections Tuesday.

TITLE=> Space Force Commander Removed After Claiming US Military's Diversity Training is 'Marxist'. ARTICLE=> A Space Force commander was reportedly relieved from his post after he criticized the U.S. military on a conservative podcast. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeier appeared on The Steve Gruber Show to discuss his new book, which claims that Marxist beliefs are becoming more common in the armed forces. On the podcast, Lohmeier said he has witnessed “fundamentally incompatible and competing narratives of what America was, is and should be.”  Lohmeier also said that "the military's inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we're receiving in the military via that industry are rooted in critical race theory which is rooted in Marxism." A Defense Department official said in a statement to CNN that Lohmeier was relieved from his command “due to loss of trust and confidence in his ability to lead.” A Department of Defense directive states that active duty service members may not participate in partisan activities, such as speaking before a partisan gathering; Lieutenant General Stephen Whiting will begin an investigation into Lohmeier's comments to see if they constitute prohibited partisan political activity.   Some coverage from the left and center tended to highlight the Defense Department's response, as well as Lohmeier's history of speaking about these issues. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to highlight details of Lohmeier's allegations, and pushback from GOP lawmakers.

TITLE=> Top Iranian Nuclear Scientist Killed in Ambush. ARTICLE=> Iranian nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, known as "Iran’s Robert Oppenheimer," was killed when a group of "unknown assailants" bombed and fired upon his car near a Tehran suburb on Friday. As of Friday afternoon, no group claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested there were "serious indications of Israeli role" and called the attack an act of "state terror." Fakhrizadeh led Iran’s covert military nuclear program, which was disbanded in 2003, and has since led other Iranian nuclear research initiatives. In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to “remember” Fakhrizadeh’s name during a presentation of stolen Iranian files. While there were no major left-right differences in coverage, coverage in outlets on all sides varied on mentioning Netanyahu’s 2018 statement and the assassination of Qassem Soleimani in January; calling the killing of Fakhrizadeh an "assassination"; and treating Israeli intelligence on the 2003 nuclear program as an allegation or a reported fact.

TITLE=> President Trump Says He Discussed Joe Biden With The Ukrainian President. ARTICLE=> President Trump says he had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July during which he discussed Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Prude died in March 2020; his autopsy lists his manner of death as “homicide” and his cause of death as “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint,” excited delirium and acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. The story was featured more prominently in left- and center-rated outlets. Coverage in some right-rated outlets included descriptions of disruption during the September protests.

Outlets across the spectrum reported on the poll. Coverage from right-rated sources typically highlighted the majority of Americans' disapproval of Biden's crime strategy.

The election for two U.S. Senate seats will determine which party will lead both chambers of Congress for the first two years of Biden's administration. Some studies highlight an increase in racial and ethnic diversity among eligible voters in the once reliably-red state of Georgia. Some say the study results highlight the importance of black voters, as well as Asian voters and Latinx voters, in the upcoming election. Other polls show that women voters in Georgia were split between Democratic and Republican candidates, with Republican candidates taking a 1-3% lead. The Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about the possibility of “ideologically motivated violence” and a foreign influence campaign on Tuesday after a GOP group challenged the voter eligibility of more than 364,000 people who may have moved, potentially disqualifying their ballots in Georgia's election.

TITLE=> Media, Fauci Acknowledge COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory After Dismissing It Initially. ARTICLE=> The theory that the COVID-19 outbreak may have begun with a laboratory leak in Wuhan, China is gaining more credence in the U.S. and internationally after it was dismissed by some early on in the pandemic. Major news sources including CNN (Left bias), the New York Times (Lean Left) and PolitiFact (Lean Left) are among the sources who initially described the hypothesis as a debunked conspiracy, but have recently deemed it at least somewhat plausible amid emerging circumstantial evidence and growing calls to investigate it further. Conversely, many right-rated media sources have reported on the theory since the pandemic’s outset.  Left-rated voices often argued that because former President Donald Trump was advancing this theory alongside other purportedly false narratives at the start of the pandemic, it became lost in the mix and not vetted properly. Voices from the right often criticized that explanation, accusing left-rated media of groupthink and blatant anti-Trump bias; some also focused on mixed messaging from public officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci.

TITLE=> Submarine Deal Between Australia, UK and US Draws Criticism from France and China. ARTICLE=> Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States announced a new trilateral security partnership on Wednesday, prompting criticism from France and China on Thursday. The partnership, dubbed “AUKUS,” will help Australia develop a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines — which will not be armed with nuclear weapons — allowing Australia to challenge China’s broad territorial claims in areas like the South China Sea. French leaders said Thursday that they were not consulted on the deal, which effectively ended France’s multi-billion dollar 2016 deal to sell less sophisticated submarines to Australia. As a result, France canceled an upcoming gala to honor French-U.S. relations, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement calling France a “vital partner” in “transatlantic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the U.S. and U.K. had a “cold war mentality” and were “applying double standards, which is extremely irresponsible.” Coverage differed on the price tag of France’s 2016 submarine deal; The New York Times said $66 billion, The Guardian said $90 billion, and Fox News said $40 billion. Coverage was widespread across the spectrum and mainly focused on Chinese and French criticism on Thursday evening.

TITLE=> Prominent Scientists Call for Deeper Investigation Into COVID-19 Origins. ARTICLE=> A letter written to the academic journal Science by 18 prominent scientists called for deeper investigations into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. "Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable," said the letter. "Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks." The scientists also criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) for its original probe into the disease's genesis and initial conclusion that a lab leak was "extremely unlikely." The letter was covered by many center- and right-rated outlets, with the right often covering it more prominently and framing the WHO and China in a negative light. Notably fewer left-rated outlets offered original reporting on the letter. Some right-rated voices also argued that the letter "disarms the cynical instrumentalization of the fight against anti-Asian racism" purportedly advanced by people who called the lab leak hypothesis a conspiracy.

Some media outlets on the left focused their coverage on fact-checking claims that Welker had Democratic ties; other left-rated outlets condemned purported "right wing smear campaigns" of Welker. Some coverage from the right concentrated on whether Welker will address the New York Post's story on Hunter Biden's emails; several others also published stories focusing on a photo of Welker and the Obamas from a 2012 White House Christmas party, and alleging that Welker's family donated thousands of dollars to Democratic presidential candidates.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Big Tech Deplatforms Trump, Raising Questions About Censorship. ARTICLE=> The banning of President Donald Trump by private tech companies has given rise to a broader discourse over the future of online speech and accusations of censorship. In addition to Trump, Twitter also suspended over 70,000 “accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content,” citing last week’s deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol building, which was planned on social media. Furthermore, Apple, Google and Amazon banned Parler, a social media app popular among conservatives, citing the app’s lack of “adequate” moderation policies against threats of violence. Voices in right-rated outlets tended to accuse tech companies of censorship and address Republicans’ push to repeal or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Voices in left- and center-rated outlets were mixed, with some voices outright defending banning Trump and others raising concerns about the future of tech companies’ power over online speech.
TITLE=> Fauci Says CDC 'Looking At' Study Suggesting 3 Feet Sufficient for Social Distancing. ARTICLE=> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is looking at a new study that suggests three feet is a sufficient distance for limiting the spread of COVID-19 with face masks and other safety measures kept in place, infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN Sunday. The study, published last week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, suggests public schools may be able to reopen safely for in-person classes as long the three-foot distance is maintained and other measured, such as mask wearing, are in place. The CDC has not issued official guidance on shortening the recommended six-foot rule to three feet. However, Fauci said that lifting pandemic restrictions is "ill-advised," and also warned that another lockdown may occur if COVID-19 cases rise again as states begin lifting restrictions. Fauci's statements received wide coverage from left- and center-rated outlets, which tended to focus on the contents of the study. Fauci's interview received less coverage overall from right-rated outlets, though Breitbart and Fox News covered the story. Some right-rated outlets highlighted Fauci's warnings of another lockdown; others focused on reception of Fauci's comments.

Voices on all sides of the political spectrum investigated the bounties and Putin's effort to retain power at great length; left-rated sources generally focused more on the former, and right-rated outlets on the latter. Some focused specifically on opposition from U.S. leaders to allowing Russia to return to the G7 summit later this year in light of the bounty reports, after President Donald Trump said previously he'd consider re-inviting Putin. Others focused on new Russian Internet regulations critics say will jeopardize privacy and free expression.

Officials including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield urged caution among protesters and recommended the use of antibody tests. Some coverage from left-rated outlets acknowledged the risk of public gatherings, while comparing it to police brutality's effects on black Americans. Many also argued that there is a link between systemic racial inequality and marginalized communities’ tendency to have higher rates of mass incarceration, poverty and disease. Coverage from right-rated outlets generally also expressed caution over a potential second coronavirus wave, with some also pushing back against equating pandemics of "risky behavior" with true disease outbreaks. Some on the right accused the left of hypocrisy for being against large gatherings just two weeks ago, and now being favorable toward them in the face of a favored political cause.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Voter Suppression and Voter Fraud in the 2020 Election. ARTICLE=> Ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, some voters are raising concerns about election integrity and voter suppression. Some claim that voter suppression has occurred through alleged attempts to sabotage the US Postal Service to delay the delivery of mail-in ballots; limiting large counties to one ballot drop-box location; and passing stricter voter ID laws to combat allegations of widespread voter fraud. Others are concentrating on reported cases of voter fraud and election security breaches nationwide, and calling for voting initiatives that combat fraud. Some coverage from left-rated outlets tended to focus on alleged voter suppression of racial minorities, especially indigenous communities. Some voices from the right condemned the left for its purported denial of election fraud, and for allegedly framing election integrity efforts as voter suppression.
TITLE=> Biden Taps Former FDA Chief David Kessler to Lead Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts. ARTICLE=> President-elect Joe Biden has selected former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler to help lead his administration’s coronavirus vaccination efforts through a revamped and renamed Operation Warp Speed. Kessler served as FDA commissioner from 1990-1997, where he oversaw the approval of new antiviral HIV/AIDS drugs and fought to regulate the tobacco industry. Kessler also co-chaired Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board during the transition period. The appointment comes as Biden plans to overhaul Operation Warp Speed in his bid to vaccinate 100 million Americans in his first 100 days. Coverage in right-rated outlets was more likely to reference Operation Warp Speed in headlines and less likely to discuss Kessler’s record at the FDA. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more likely to describe alleged “failures” of Operation Warp Speed.

TITLE=> Biden Says Texas Abortion Ban Will Cause 'Unconstitutional Chaos'. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden on Thursday called the newly-enacted Texas law that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected an "unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights." The Heartbeat Act (SB 8), which took effect on Wednesday after the Supreme Court allowed it to stand, has received sharp dissenting reactions as the law empowers citizens to sue health care providers or any individual suspected of helping a woman get an abortion. Biden said his administration will launch a “whole-of-government effort to respond to this decision” and examine “what steps the federal government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions as protected by Roe [v. Wade].” He also emphasized how the law is so extreme that it "does not even allow for exceptions in the case of rape or incest."  Some left-rated outlets highlighted how Biden used the word "abortion" for the first time during a public remark or statement on Wednesday in his time as president. As a practicing Catholic, President Biden has been an inconsistent supporter of abortion rights but has moderated his views over time.

ARTICLE=> Vice President Mike Pence has come under increased political pressure and media scrutiny following statements made by President Donald Trump just one day before Congress meets to confirm President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. At a Monday rally in Georgia, Trump said, “I hope that Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you…Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.” On Tuesday, Trump falsely claimed on Twitter that “the Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors”; this power doesn't fall to the vice president, but rather to state lawmakers, who must submit a written objection. The White House confirmed on Tuesday that while a statement by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) seemed to imply otherwise, Pence would preside over the confirmation vote on Wednesday. Coverage came mostly from left- and center-rated outlets and tended to describe Trump as “pressuring” Pence. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to come from outlets that had previously published opinions casting Trump in a negative light.

TITLE=> House Passes $3.5T Budget Blueprint. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday night, the House of Representatives passed the blueprint for a $3.5 trillion budget plan. The rule proposed to proceed with the plan passed with a 220 to 212 vote; all Democrats voted in favor, and all Republicans opposed it. House leadership also struck a deal with moderate Democrats on a path towards voting on the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in late September.  If the budget resolution is adopted by the House, the Democrats could use a process called budget reconciliation to employ a simple majority to pass the legislation without any Republican support.

TITLE=> Perspectives: New York Times Report on Trump's Tax Returns. ARTICLE=> An extensive New York Times report detailing President Donald Trump's financial history and tax information has commanded attention throughout the media this week. Some left-rated voices say the records prove Trump to be a hypocrite and poor money manager who purportedly has shady financial connections and manipulates the system to avoid paying taxes. Other voices throughout the spectrum, particularly on the right, say the financial records indicating low income tax payments are normal for a businessperson who has multiple large assets and revenue streams. More analyses are concentrated on how the news could impact the presidential race.
TITLE=> Moderate Democrats Voice Concern Over Sanders Surge. ARTICLE=> Moderate Democrats and Democratic Party loyalists are voicing concern — even panic — over Sen. Bernie Sanders' apparent cementing of his front-runner status. Moderate Democrats believe a Sanders primary win would seal Donald Trump's reelection as president.

TITLE=> Biden Defends Afghanistan Withdrawal After Ending War Overseas. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden defended his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan during a national address on Tuesday afternoon, insisting that the Aug. 31 deadline was "designed to save American lives." The final U.S. military transport plane departed Afghanistan on Monday night, formally marking the end of America’s longest war. Biden reiterated that the conflict "should've ended long ago" as the nation no longer had a "clear purpose" for being stationed in Afghanistan. He then praised the U.S. military for "their execution of the dangerous retrograde from Afghanistan as scheduled," calling the withdrawal an “extraordinary success.” As for the reported 100 to 200 Americans that still remain in Afghanistan, Biden said "there is no deadline" to get them out "if they want to come out." Coverage from across the spectrum highlighted how a large majority of Americans have been critical of Biden's withdrawal strategy. Right-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how Biden "pinned partial blame" on former President Donald Trump for the chaotic nature of the withdrawal. Left-rated outlets were more likely to mention how Trump signed an agreement last year with the Taliban for a U.S. withdrawal by May 1, 2021.

TITLE=> Biden Aims To Vaccinate 70% of American Adults by July 4. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden announced Tuesday his new goal of administering at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine to 70 percent of American adults by July 4. According to federal data, roughly one-third of the population are currently fully vaccinated. "If we succeed in this effort, as we did with the last, then Americans will have taken a serious step towards returning to normal," Biden said, referring to his previous goal of administering 200 million COVID-19 vaccines before his 100th day in office. Biden said the next phase of the vaccination effort focuses on people who are more hesitant to get the shot. To motivate those who are hesitant, Biden's speech Tuesday pointed to the role of the Trump administration in the vaccines' development, and to CDC guidelines saying that vaccinated individuals are not required to wear masks. Biden also said that if the FDA authorizes the vaccine for adolescents, his administration would equip 20,000 pharmacy sites and pediatricians with vaccines in the coming weeks. The story received coverage across the political spectrum. Some left- and center-rated outlets pointed to polls showing a higher rate of vaccine hesitancy among Republicans. Coverage from the right tended to focus on the logistics needed to meet Biden's goal.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Labor Day 2021. ARTICLE=> In addition to marking the summer season's unofficial end, the Labor Day holiday is a day to recognize the U.S. worker's role in keeping the country moving. For media outlets, columnists and pundits, the holiday has different meanings and elicits varying points of view from left and right, especially on the subject of unions. Data from Pew Research Center (Center bias) suggests that as of July 2021, 74% of Democrats and Democrat-leaners say labor unions have a positive effect; just 34% of Republicans and Republican-leaners agree. Opinions about Labor Day were more common from left- and center-rated writers and news outlets. Many of these praised frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and advocated for the importance of unions and organized labor movements. Some opinions from right-rated outlets criticized unions and their advocates' purported attempts to make Labor Day less about workers and more about unions; these opinions also pointed to data that suggests U.S. union participation is declining. Coverage across the spectrum highlighted the fact that pandemic jobless benefits expire for over 7 million people Monday.
TITLE=> U.S. Sets Record for New Daily COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalization. ARTICLE=> The United States confirmed more than 140,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday — marking a record spike from 100,000 cases last week. John Hopkins University reported that Texas was the first state in the country to pass 1 million cases while the number of total cases in the U.S. passed 10.2 million. Coronavirus hospitalizations have increased 40% in the past two weeks, reaching 61,964 as of Tuesday according to the COVID-19 Tracking Project. Coverage from across the political spectrum reported on the record numbers and analyzed the numbers overall and in each region; some right-rated outlets raised concerns that the spike may be due to large celebrations after media outlets projected Joe Biden as the 2020 presidential winner.
TITLE=> FDA Approves Pfizer Booster Shots for People Over 65 or High Risk. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a third shot of the Pfizer and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for individuals ages 65 and older, and those who are at high risk or have high-risk jobs (such as health care workers and teachers).  The CDC estimates that about 53 million Americans are aged 65 and older, and another 20 million are health care workers, and up to 100 million people have medical conditions that put them at increased risk.  The FDA approval clears the way for fast distribution of the shots, which would be administered six months after the second dose. Last week, an advisory panel to the FDA rejected approval of the booster shot for other individuals, saying there was not enough evidence to support the authorization. 
TITLE=> Justice Department Files Antitrust Case Against Google. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice and 11 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google for allegedly breaking the law in using its market power to fend off rivals.

TITLE=> Capitol Police Rejected Offers of Federal Help Before and During Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> The U.S. Capitol Police reportedly rejected federal help in the days leading up to the planned Capitol protests on Jan. 6, and again as the Capitol building was breached Wednesday. The Associated Press reported that the Capitol police added more personnel but were prepared only for a free speech demonstration, despite the Pentagon's offer of National Guard assistance on Jan. 3, and the Justice Department's offer of FBI agents, which were rejected by Capitol police. Five people died as a result of Wednesday's events. U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, Sergeant at Arms of the Senate Michael Stenger and Sergeant at Arms of the House Paul Irving all resigned after pressure from lawmakers. The story received coverage from across the political spectrum. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight the officials who resigned after pressure from lawmakers; some voices from the left criticized Capitol police for not being prepared despite adequate time.
TITLE=> Appeals Court Weighs Constitutionality of Obamacare. ARTICLE=>  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans is considering overturning a Texas judge's ruling that Obamacare is unconstitutional. A challenge led by Republican-held states led to the initial unconstitutional ruling in December 2018. If Obamacare is again declared unconstitutional by a federal judge, another appeal may be brought to the U.S. Supreme Court as the 2020 Presidential race heats up. Left-leaning media outlets focused on the improbability of a successful lawsuit for Republicans and the consequences for Americans who benefit from Obamacare in their coverage of this story. On the right, coverage focused on the technical side of the lawsuit, analyzing how and why the ruling that Obamacare is unconstitutional may be upheld.
TITLE=> Stabbing of British Lawmaker Investigated as Possible Terrorist Attack. ARTICLE=> British counterterrorism officers are reportedly leading the investigation into the Friday morning stabbing of David Amess, a Conservative Party member of the U.K. Parliament. Amess was stabbed to death at a meeting with constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, east of London. Police arrested a 25-year-old man at the scene and later released a statement saying they were “not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the wider public.” Police also said they had not yet determined whether the incident was a terrorist attack, saying, “It will be for investigators to determine whether or not this is a terrorist incident.” Coverage was widespread and prominently featured across the spectrum on Friday, with most outlets describing Amess as a “Conservative” politician or lawmaker. With notable exceptions like Fox News and The New York Times, most outlets connected the Conservative Party to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

ARTICLE=> In a new book to be released on October 15th, journalist Ronan Farrow writes that NBC knew of several other sexual misconduct allegations involving disgraced Today Show anchor Matt Lauer prior to his November 2017 firing. Farrow writes of several non-disclosure agreements made by NBC with female staff members involving Lauer before Brooke Nevils' 2017 accusation that directly led to Lauer's firing on Nov. 29. NBC news maintains that it fired Lauer within 24 hours of Nevils' allegation, calling other details in "Catch and Kill" false.
TITLE=> Ginsburg and Gorsuch Flip Sides. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the respondent, on Monday morning. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a traditionally liberal justice, concurred with the conservative majority- while Neil Gorsuch, a Trump pick and traditionally conservative justice, sided with the liberal dissent. Mont v. United States dealt with criminal charges being pressed on the petitioner for violating his supervised released conditions. However, the petitioner believed that the United States had violated the Constitution by having him serve time for violating said release conditions, outside the time in which they applied, due to pretrial delays.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Breaking Down the Small 'Justice for J6' Rally. ARTICLE=> A demonstration in front of the U.S. Capitol Saturday was small and mostly uneventful, following concerns from some about potential violence and unrest from supporters of former President Donald Trump. Reports across the spectrum highlighted how the 100-150 "Justice for J6" attendees were far outnumbered by law enforcement, journalists and counterprotesters. Demonstrators were there in support of people arrested for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot; organizers argue that some of those charged in connection to the Capitol riot were nonviolent and were exercising their right to protest. Capitol Police reportedly made two arrests for illegal possession of weapons; they were joined in monitoring the rally by other regional police departments and the National Guard.  Concerns about violence were more common from left- and center-rated outlets leading up the rally; after the fact, coverage of the rally's uneventfulness has been more prominent in right-rated outlets. Right-rated voices often accused left-rated media outlets and commentators of greatly exaggerating concerns about the rally leading up to Saturday and questioned the lack of coverage from left-rated sources about the rally's uneventfulness. Some left-rated voices framed the rally's small size as a bad sign for pro-Trump Republicans; others on the left said despite the low turnout, the rally was dangerous and aimed to "free many of the insurrectionists of responsibility and cast them as victims."
TITLE=> TikTok To Cut Ties with Chinese Parent Company After Trump Says He'll Ban TikTok in the U.S.. ARTICLE=> After President Donald Trump said he would ban popular social media app TikTok from the United States on Friday, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has proposed a deal in which ByteDance would exit completely and Microsoft Corp would take over TikTok in the U.S. The White House has been looking to ban Chinese social media apps since last month, when China imposed internet censorship laws in Hong Kong. Last month ByteDance said it was looking to move its headquarters out of Hong Kong to avoid the censorship mandate. As of Saturday, coverage of this story remained fairly consistent across outlets on all sides of the political spectrum; coverage from the right noted that Microsoft Corp's stocks increased slightly after it was reportedly in talks to acquire TikTok.
TITLE=> Trumps Says U.S. to Pull Out From Nuclear Treaty With Russia. ARTICLE=> Saturday morning, President Trump said he would withdraw the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. This action was due to what President Trump said, “violated the agreement” and sparked the ideas for developing a new set of weapons.
TITLE=> Kamala Harris Discusses Her Approach to Immigration. ARTICLE=> Vice President Kamala Harris said her approach to the immigration surge at the southern U.S. border was based on the perspective that "most people don't want to leave home" in an interview with CNN's "State of the Union" Sunday. Harris was called upon by President Joe Biden to address the surge of migrants at the border. The vice president framed the surge as a long-term issue rooted in the migrants’ home countries, saying most migrants are either "fleeing some harm or they cannot stay and satisfy the basic necessities of life." Harris said she will call on United Nations allies for help at the southern border, and will meet with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López in upcoming weeks. Harris has met with several members of Biden's Cabinet to discuss efforts, and has been working with U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, to bring in international resources to help at the border. Harris has not yet visited the southern border, but reportedly plans to travel to Central America in June. In the interview, the vice president also discussed her relationship with Biden and criminal justice legislation.  Coverage from the left tended to focus on Harris' comments about the root causes of the border situation; some left-rated outlets also claimed that Republicans are using Harris' border assignment to frame Harris as the problem. Some on the right, including Senator Ted Cruz, criticized Harris for not yet visiting the border, and for her past comments regarding former President Donald Trump's handling of the border.
TITLE=> Trump Tweet Sparks Outrage. ARTICLE=> On June 29, President Trump sparked outrage across the aisle with a vitriolic tweet aimed at Mika Brzezinski, co-host of Morning Joe.
TITLE=> Biden, Putin Hold Separate Press Conferences After Summit. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, after which the two leaders held separate press conferences. Both leaders said the talks went well, with Biden calling for "a more predictable and stable relationship" and Putin denying Russian responsibility for cyberattacks against the U.S. Topics discussed included cybersecurity, strategic stability, regional conflicts, and human rights, including Alexei Navalny. There was a chaotic moment at the start of the summit, when security confronted reporters scuffling to photograph the two leaders. The summit lasted about three hours, shorter than the five hours White House officials expected.  Most outlets on all sides had live coverage of the summit and the press conferences. Coverage in left- and center-rated outlets tended to focus on the leaders' statements and highlight tensions between the two countries. Headlines in right-rated outlets tended to portray Biden as weak, highlighting that Putin's press conference was first and questioning whether Biden "stood his ground."
TITLE=> Supreme Court Hears Gun Rights Case. ARTICLE=> The Supreme Court heard its first major gun rights case since 2008 Monday, as the nine justices listened to arguments in an appeal by three New York City gun owners and the state's National Rifle Association affiliate. The challenge is aimed at a now-defunct NYC provision that prevented lawful gun owners from bringing their firearms outside of the city; gun rights advocates say that provision violated their Second Amendment rights. The ruling is due in June. Most reports, especially from left and center-rated outlets, focused on the events of Monday's hearing, which reportedly indicated that the court is unlikely to issue a major ruling in regards to the case.
TITLE=> Trump, Biden and Pence Visit Georgia Ahead of the State's Senate Runoff Elections. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden each visited Georgia Monday ahead of Tuesday's U.S. Senate runoff races, while Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks from a Georgia church. The race is key in determining which party will control the Senate during Biden's upcoming term. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are running for the seats of Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Purdue. If the Republicans keep their seats, the party would maintain their 52-48 seat majority, giving them the power to potentially block Biden's agenda when he takes office. More than 3 million Georgia residents have already cast early votes, a record for the state's runoff elections. Biden, Trump and Pence's visits received coverage from across the political spectrum; outlets on all sides also provided readers with analysis of the upcoming runoffs and predictions.
TITLE=> Trump Threatens to Send Military in to Quash Riots. ARTICLE=> On Monday, President Trump vowed to deploy the military to control the streets of America unless governors take sufficient efforts to quell riots.

TITLE=> Georgia Senate Candidates Debate Ahead of Consequential Runoff Elections. ARTICLE=> Candidates in Georgia's U.S. Senate runoff elections participated in debates hosted by the Atlanta Press Club on Sunday. Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler faced off against Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock, and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff faced off against an empty podium—his opponent, Republican Senator David Perdue, “declined to participate." The outcome of the Georgia Senate runoff elections will determine the party balance in the Senate. Most coverage on all sides focused on Loeffler and Warnock's debate. Coverage in left-rated outlets and some right-rated outlets focused on Loeffler not acknowledging President Donald Trump's state-certified defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Coverage in right-rated outlets tended to focus on Warnock avoiding questions about socialism and court-packing.
TITLE=> Clinton and DNC Funded Trump-Russia Dossier. ARTICLE=> Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee hired a Washington firm to research and create a dossier that accused Donald Trump of having multiple ties to Russia, including allegations of collusion during the election.
TITLE=> The Biden Vaccine Mandate's Impact on Private Businesses. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden announced last week that private U.S. companies with over 100 employees must mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for employees or test unvaccinated employees weekly. The mandate on private businesses has raised legal questions, and several Republican governors have already committed to not enforcing it; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has threatened fines for companies that do comply with the mandate. Meanwhile, companies that don’t follow the mandate can reportedly face fines of over $13,000 per violation. The news comes at an already trying time for America's workforce; there were a record-high 10.9 million job openings at the end of July as companies struggle to fill positions and some Americans continue to struggle to find employment. Divided media narratives make it difficult to tell how private businesses feel about the mandate overall. Coverage from left-rated sources often framed businesses as ready and willing to comply with the mandate, highlighting large companies that had already agreed to it, such as Disney and United Airlines. Reports from right-rated sources often did the opposite, questioning how the government would enforce the mandate and focusing on business owners who were concerned that the mandate would diminish or frustrate their workforce. 
TITLE=> Dozens Charged In College Admissions Cheating Scheme. ARTICLE=> Federal prosecutors have charged dozens, including celebrity parents and coaches, in college entrance bribery scheme.
TITLE=> 45 Senate Republicans Vote to Reject Trump Trial as Unconstitutional. ARTICLE=> In a failed effort to block an impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, 45 Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to reject the trial as unconstitutional. Five Republicans joined the Senate's 48 Democrats and two Independents in voting in favor of the trial. Many see this as an indicator that Trump will not be convicted of inciting insurrection at the Capitol; 12 additional Republicans would have to support conviction when the trial begins in early February. Some media coverage on both sides highlighted Sen. Rand Paul's remark that impeachment is "dead on arrival."
TITLE=> John Bolton Willing to Testify in Impeachment Trial. ARTICLE=> Former national security adviser John Bolton has announced that he is now willing to testify if subpoenaed in the impeachment trial of his former boss, President Donald Trump. Bolton is considered one of the crucial witnesses for the trial; he left the White House in September 2019 after chronic disagreements with other members of the administration. Most reporting focused on the potential pressure that Bolton's announcement puts on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R - KY) to allow witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial.
TITLE=> US House Creates Jan. 6 Committee. ARTICLE=> The U.S. House voted Wednesday to create a select committee to investigate the origins of the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. The House voted 222-190, almost entirely along party lines; Republican representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger were the only two GOP members to vote in favor. In May, 35 House Republicans joined Democrats in support of creating an independent commission with bipartisan outside experts; many oppose, however, a select committee with appointees by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “It will find the truth — which clearly the Republicans fear,” Pelosi said. The committee will have 13 members; Pelosi will appoint eight, and five will be appointed after consultation with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. There's no timetable for the committee's creation.  Outlets on the left and center tended to focus on the committee and recount details of Jan. 6. Right-rated outlets tended to highlight voices from the right who criticize the committee as "too partisan" and who say it is unnecessary in light of separate bipartisan probes conducted earlier this year. 
TITLE=> Personal Finance in the Age of Coronavirus. ARTICLE=> The ways Americans are spending, saving and using their money during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic have become a measuring stick for evaluating the outbreak's financial impact on the general public. While some individuals are closing their small business for good or unable to make credit card payments, others are spending stimulus checks on non-essential items. Some left-rated voices have cited the pandemic's financial consequences as reason to develop a Universal Basic Income. Conversely, some right-rated outlets are focusing more on the purported wastefulness of federal stimulus plans and other finance-related virus legislation.
TITLE=> Mueller Issues Indictments Against Russians. ARTICLE=> On Friday,13 Russian people and three Russian companies were indicted on various charges. Robert Mueller's indictment accuses them of conspiring to interfere with “US political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.” Across the political spectrum, publications have tried to interpret what these indictments mean for the future of the investigation as well as President Trump.
TITLE=> Sudan to Normalize Relations with Israel, Trump Announces. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump announced Friday that Sudan would join Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in normalizing relations with Israel. The same day, the White House announced that Trump had rescinded Sudan’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism after Sudan transferred $335 million to victims of the 1998 al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. As a result, Sudan’s struggling economy will be able to receive aid from international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. originally designated Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 for harboring Osama bin Laden and others. Coverage was mostly balanced on all sides. Coverage in some right-rated outlets mentioned Trump’s past Nobel Peace Prize nominations; some reports from left-rated sources referenced on Palestine's apparent rejection of the move.

TITLE=> Capitol Secure After Trump Supporters Breach Building; Pelosi Says Vote Count Will Proceed Wednesday Night. ARTICLE=> One woman is dead after being shot  Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., which is now secure after being breached by hundreds of Trump supporters. People clashed with police and entered the building seeking to disrupt Congress during Wednesday's electoral vote tally, which was adjourned before likely moving to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated and moved to an undisclosed location, along with the soon-to-be-counted physical votes. President Donald Trump, who held a rally making unproven claims of decisive voter fraud in D.C. Wednesday morning, tweeted a request for supporters to remain peaceful and avoid violence amid the chaos. Biden also addressed the nation, saying the events represented an assault on democracy and casting blame on Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office released a statement saying lawmakers will continue the tally Wednesday night. The news received major coverage from across the political spectrum. Some coverage from the right tended to focus on Trump's calls for his supporters to be peaceful. Many voices from the left tended to focus on Trump's encouragement of protests in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 as well as his ongoing election challenges, and framed the protests as a "coup" and as Trump's "legacy."

Some coverage in center- and left-rated outlets also focused on women reentering the workforce.

TITLE=> Office of Special Counsel: Conway Violated the Hatch Act. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the Office for the Special Counsel released a report stating that Kellyanne Conway, adviser to the President, violated the Hatch Act a number of times. The Hatch Act prevents some employees of the executive branch from making politically-motivated statements, with exceptions for the President, Vice President, and  other specific positions- none of which Conway held. According to the report, Conway violated the Hatch Act by repeatedly disparaging Democratic candidates during interviews, social media posts, and press releases. The Hatch Act was implemented in 1939 and designed to keep non-political appointments away from partisan divide. The White House has rejected the report, and insists that the Department of Justice withdraw it.
TITLE=> Biden Condemns "Lawlessness", Calls for Safety From "4 More Years". ARTICLE=> Joe Biden condemned violence and criticized President Donald Trump's leadership during a visit to a Pittsburgh steel mill on Monday. Biden said rioting, looting and setting fires is "...not protesting. It's lawlessness plain and simple...it divides instead of unites.” Biden went on to criticize Trump, saying his "divisive" speech is to blame for "fomenting" polarization and violence. Some left-rated outlets tended to focus on Biden's condemnation of violence and his emphasis on unity; some left- and center-rated outlets framed Biden's speech as having put the spotlight on Trump, or blaming Trump for the violence. Coverage from the right focused more on Biden's criticisms of Trump and tended to frame Biden as being defensive of his stances on recent violence that has descended from protests.
TITLE=> US Jobless Claims Dip to 385,000. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims dropped to 385,000 last week.  This is the first time during the pandemic that the number has dipped below 400,000.

TITLE=> Perspectives: The Errant US Drone Strike That Killed 10 Civilians in Kabul. ARTICLE=> A U.S. drone strike that mistakenly killed 10 civilians in Kabul, Afghanistan has prompted criticism of the U.S. military and the Biden administration from across the spectrum. The Pentagon called the strike a "tragic mistake" Friday following an internal investigation. It was initially reported that the strike, which came days after the Kabul suicide bombing that killed over 170 people, killed terrorists who posed an imminent threat to Kabul's airport. The Air Force has been directed to appoint a general who will review the Pentagon's investigation. Among the 10 killed in the strike were seven children and a former U.S. aid worker.  Voices across the spectrum called for consequences for U.S. military leadership. Criticism of the strike was much more common from right-rated voices. Some compared the media's purportedly weak coverage of the mistake with the outrage that followed a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general last year, which was authorized by former President Donald Trump. Few left-rated voices published opinions about the strike; some left-rated outlets did publish "letters to the editor" from readers condemning it and urging leaders be held accountable.

ARTICLE=> In a pre-recorded speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized China for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying “the United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions.” Trump also called the virus “the Chinese virus,” criticized China’s environmental record, and said the World Health Organization was “virtually controlled by China.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned against a potential “Great Fracture” splitting the world between American and Chinese systems. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s pre-recorded speech rejected “Cold War mentality” and warned that “[relations among countries] must not be lorded over by those who wave a strong fist at others.” Some coverage on all sides used sensationalist language like “blasted” and “fiery.” Coverage in some left-rated outlets included criticisms of Trump’s coronavirus response. Coverage in some right-rated outlets portrayed China’s coronavirus response as “botched” outside of descriptions of Trump’s criticisms.

TITLE=> Perspectives: News Outlets and Political Endorsement. ARTICLE=> Editorial boards from major news outlets nationwide are sticking with tradition and endorsing presidential candidates in the 2020 election. According to the American Presidency Project, President Donald Trump received endorsement from seven major news outlets, including the New York Post, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Boston Herald. More than 45 news outlets expressed support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, with some outlets like USA Today and Scientific American giving Biden their first ever presidential endorsement. While newspaper endorsements are typically made to help undecided voters choose a candidate, several columns featured in center-rated media outlets have questioned if endorsements are worth the risk of potentially alienating part of a publication’s audience in a polarized political climate. Outlets who endorse Trump tended to highlight his accomplishments while in office; those who endorsed Biden focused on his plan, often comparing it to Trump's purportedly weak second-term agenda.
TITLE=> Perspectives: The Plan to 'Make Federal Buildings Beautiful Again'. ARTICLE=> An executive order has been drafted that, if signed into law by President Trump, would require federal buildings in Washington and many other parts of the U.S. to be built with inspiration from Greek and Roman architecture, similar to the White House. The idea has drawn praise from some on the right, who argue that classical architecture endures for millennia and is good for civic life because people will want to dwell around it. Many on the left criticized the idea, arguing that limiting architectural styling options for federal construction could negatively impact the nation's culture. Others on the right criticized voices who framed the order as racist, fascist, or totalitarian.
TITLE=> Georgia Removes 102K 'Obsolete and Outdated' Registered Voters. ARTICLE=> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced Friday that 101,789 "obsolete and outdated" names would be deleted from the state's voter registration rolls as part of maintenance to keep the rolls updated. Individuals do have a chance to save their registrations before they’re removed; officials will mail notices warning of the potential cancellations, and registrations will be restored if individuals respond within 40 days. The names to be canceled make up 1.3% of Georgia's registered voters. Maintenance to keep state voter lists up-to-date is typical, but procedures often differ from state to state. 	Coverage from left- and center-rated outlets often framed the news in the context of ongoing Republican-sponsored election security legislation; some on the left see those bills as efforts to suppress voters. Conversely, reports from right-rated sources framed Georgia's move as more routine and less controversial.
TITLE=> Ocasio-Cortez Says Pelosi and Schumer Need to Go. ARTICLE=> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) challenged the leadership of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a Wednesday episode of The Intercept’s “Intercepted with Jeremy Scahill.” When asked if they “need to go,” Ocasio-Cortez replied, “I mean, I think so.” Ocasio-Cortez also criticized the “structural shifts that these two personalities have led,” which purportedly “concentrate power in party leadership of both parties, frankly, but in Democratic Party leadership to such a degree that an individual member has far less power than they did 30, 40, 50 years ago.” Pelosi has said that her current term would be her last as Speaker. Coverage in right-rated outlets was featured more prominently than in left-rated outlets, and focused on Ocasio-Cortez’s criticism of the Democratic Party. Coverage in left-rated outlets was more sparse and focused more generally on Ocasio-Cortez’s statements.
TITLE=> Springfield, MO: Walmart Gunman Thwarted. ARTICLE=> A 20 year-old man armed with a rifle and body armor entered a Springfield, Missouri Walmart on Thursday evening, and filmed himself walking around the store before being apprehended. No shots were fired, and police arrested the man without incident. His motive remains unclear. Many right-leaning media outlets have concentrated on the actions of the retired fireman who was legally armed and apprehended the suspect, through which he was credited with saving fellow customers. Most left-leaning media outlets have focused on the potential threat presented by a rifle-wielding man in a public place after two recent mass shootings.
TITLE=> Trump Says He Won't Declare Early Victory, May Start Legal Battle Against Counting Late Ballots. ARTICLE=> On Sunday evening, President Donald Trump denied an Axios report saying he'd declare early victory on Election Day, but suggested he might pursue a lawsuit against counting ballots received after Nov. 3. The president went on to say he thought it was a "terrible thing" when states are permitted to tabulate ballots after the election, and that "as soon as that election's over, we're going in with our lawyers." Trump advisor Jason Miller also said Sunday morning that the Trump administration may begin a legal battle against including ballots counted after Election Day, saying he believed the electoral college would decide the election on Tuesday. Some states, including swing states Pennsylvania and North Carolina, have extended their ballot deadlines until after Nov. 3. Coverage from right-rated sources tended to focus on Trump's claim that the Axios report was false. Some outlets across the spectrum focused on the likelihood and potential outcomes of a Trump administration lawsuit to stop mail-in ballots from being counted after Election Day.
TITLE=> 'Social Distancing' as Americans Urged to Stay Home, Avoid Gathering. ARTICLE=> In response to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, public officials and medical professionals alike have called for 'social distancing,' telling people to limit time in public to prevent contracting or spreading the virus.

TITLE=> Perspectives: Ted Cruz Returns from Cancún as Texas Suffers Deadly Winter Storms. ARTICLE=> Texas Sen. Ted Cruz received widespread criticism this week after flying to a resort in Cancún, Mexico with his family to avoid the deadly winter storms that left millions of Texans without power. Cruz flew back to Texas on Thursday, telling reporters the flight was “obviously a mistake,” he just wanted “to be a good dad,” and he had “second thoughts almost immediately.” Leaked group text messages obtained by Reform Austin and confirmed by The New York Times showed that Cruz’s family invited several neighbors to join them. Cruz also received criticism for reportedly leaving behind his poodle, Snowflake, at his home in Houston, TX. Outlets on all sides featured distinct articles for each development in this story. Many prominent left-rated outlets featured voices criticizing Cruz, with some calling for his resignation. Relatively few right-rated outlets published opinions on Cruz; voices from the right tended to defend Cruz and criticize the left for focusing more on Cruz than New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's nursing home scandal.
TITLE=> Gavin Newsom Recall Effort Reaches Enough Signatures to Qualify for Ballot. ARTICLE=> The California secretary of state said Monday that the effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom has garnered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The recall effort gathered 1,626,042 valid signatures, which exceeds the 1,495,709 signatures required; the number is expected to grow, since counties have until April 29 to confirm the validity of remaining signatures. After that, California residents have a 30-day period to withdraw their signatures; a recall election will then be held unless a sufficient number of signatures are withdrawn. Then, the Department of Finance will have 30 days to estimate the cost of the recall election, and the Joint Legislative Budget Committee will have 30 days after that to review the cost before the lieutenant governor sets a date for the recall election. The recall ballot requires more than 50% of voters to vote "yes" to remove Newsom; the replacement candidate with the most votes is elected governor. This comes after former Olympian and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner announced a run for governor should Newsom be recalled. Others in the running include businessman John Cox, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and former Rep. Doug Ose. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from the left tended to focus on the details of the recall process, while outlets on the right and center highlighted polls predicting the outcome of the recall effort.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Obama's 60th Birthday Party. ARTICLE=> Former President Barack Obama's 60th birthday party was covered by both left and right media this past week, but for different reasons. Obama's party Saturday on Martha's Vineyard featured friends, family and high-profile celebrities; a video posted to social media showed guests dancing and singing with the former president. Obama's spokesperson said last week that they would "significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends" due "to the new spread of the Delta variant." Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated Martha's Vineyard an area with "high" community COVID-19 transmission. 	The party was a bigger story on the right side of the media spectrum overall. Right-rated outlets and voices often highlighted the fact that guests weren't wearing masks, and accused mainstream media of ignoring the party and potential COVID-19 concerns; some on the right broke from that narrative, saying the Obamas shouldn't be criticized because they "did what everyone should be allowed to do." The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported last Thursday that Obama had canceled the party; the same day, Snopes (Lean Left) published a fact-check of the claim that Obama scaled back the party, rating it as "True." The few left-rated outlets that published coverage after the party focused on the celebrity guests and analyzing Obama's future.
TITLE=> NBC, DNC: Announces Debate Lineups. ARTICLE=> On Friday morning, NBC announced it's lineup for a two-day debate event, featuring 20 of the Democratic candidates running for president. While the lineups were randomized, the DNC assured voters that the front runners would not all be stacked on one day. However, on June 26th, Elizabeth Warren is the only front runner on stage; the rest of the nine who will share a stage with Warren do not crack double digits in any given poll. Beto O' Rourke, Tulsi Gabbard, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Jay Inslee, Amy Klobuchar, Bill de Blasio, Tim Ryan, and John Delaney will share the stage with Warren. On June 27th, the marquee match-up will be between Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg- the top three contenders according to Iowa polls. They will share a stage with Andrew Yang, John Hickenlooper, Eric Swalwell, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, and Kamala Harris. Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris make up four of the top five candidates in national polls. Some candidates did not qualify for the debates- including Mike Gravel, Seth Moulton, Steve Bullock, and Wayne Messam.

TITLE=> Key Congressional Votes on Biden Agenda, Debt Ceiling Set for This Week. ARTICLE=> Two Congressional votes set for this week are key for the Biden administration's spending plans. A House vote on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package is set for Thursday, and a Senate vote is set for Monday to suspend the debt ceiling and avoid a government shutdown. Republicans are expected to vote down the debt ceiling measure, leaving Democrats to figure out how to keep the government funded while also passing trillions of dollars worth of spending bills. Work continues on crafting and securing votes for the administration's $3.5 trillion budget bill. Many sources focused on the pricetags for the legislation and the political maneuvering needed from Democrats to advance the bills. Sources across the spectrum framed the coming days as pivotal for the Biden administration and the president's agenda; many on all sides also painted smooth passage of the bills as unlikely based on lack of support from moderate Democrats. Some coverage also highlighted how the legislation, if passed, will have vast implications for American life.
TITLE=> California, New York On Lockdown. ARTICLE=> New York and California enacted state-wide lockdowns this week in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

TITLE=> Census Bureau to Release 2020 Data That Will Guide Redistricting. ARTICLE=> On Thursday, the U.S. Census Bureau released data from the 2020 Census that will guide redistricting.  The results, which are being released late due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will be used by states to redraw district lines for the U.S. House of Representatives based on where residents live. Democrats will control redistricting for 75 U.S. House seats in eight states; Republicans control redistricting for 187 U.S. House seats in 20 states.  Districts in other 16 other states will be drawn by either split state legislative chambers or independent commissions. The census figures will serve as a benchmark for things such as death rate, market research, and government-funding formulas.  About two-thirds of Americans ended up answering the census on their own, which normally results in more accurate and complete results.

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released last week says Biden's overall approval rating is 43%, the lowest of his presidency so far and six percentage points less than it was in July. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released this week says 51% of Americans disapprove of Biden's performance so far, compared to 44% who approve; in late June, 50% approved and 42% disapproved. According to FiveThirtyEight (Center bias), Biden's approval rating has fallen roughly 10 points since March. 	The president's declining approval rating was covered across the spectrum, and highlighted especially prominently by some right-rated outlets. Many reports, regardless of bias, framed the opinion poll data in the context of the Afghanistan withdrawal and continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Some left-rated voices predicted how Biden's falling popularity could impact Democrats' chances in next year's midterm elections.

TITLE=> Biden Administration Tells Supreme Court It Thinks ACA Is Constitutional. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration told the Supreme Court it considers the Affordable Care Act (ACA) constitutional, reversing the Trump administration's position on the healthcare law. A Justice Department lawyer sent a letter to the court on Wednesday changing the government’s position in a case called California v. Texas, which was argued last November; a decision has yet to be announced. In November, Trump, along with several other Republican-led states, argued that the ACA (also known as Obamacare) was unconstitutional because its individual mandate, a tax which propped up the law’s constitutionality in past cases, was removed by Congress in 2017. They argued that the individual mandate was essential to the ACA and that the ACA must fall as a result. As vice president under the Obama administration, Biden played a key role in passing the legislation through Congress in 2010. The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from the left and the center tended to focus on the details of the case; some right-rated outlets also highlighted reactions from Republican lawmakers and attempted to predict the outcome of the case.
TITLE=> Congressman Sets April 23 Deadline for IRS To Turn Over Trump's Tax Returns. ARTICLE=> House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Richard Neal (D - MA) set an April 23 deadline for the IRS to turn over President Trump’s tax returns.

If April 23 passes without the tax returns being provided or a resolution being met, House Democrats and the Trump administration may end up in federal court. The administration missed an April 10 deadline as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin consulted with the Justice Department about the law to determine whether Neal had a legitimate legislative purpose to make the request. Under the law, Neal can request any taxpayer’s returns and the Treasury Department “shall furnish” them.
TITLE=> Pensacola Shooting Under Investigation After Four Killed. ARTICLE=> A shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida left four people dead Friday morning.

TITLE=> High COVID-19 Case Counts, Mask Debates Put Florida in Spotlight. ARTICLE=> Florida's seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases has risen steadily in August amid the spread of the Delta variant, and the state currently has the highest seven-day average of new cases in the country. According to New York Times (Lean Left bias) data, an average of roughly 16,500 people in Florida are hospitalized with COVID-19 every day, the most of any state; Texas (12,357) is the only other state with an average higher than 10,000. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) opposes coronavirus restrictions including mask and vaccine mandates; he has called on schools to let parents decide whether children wear masks, and has threatened financial repercussions for schools and administrators who defy the edict. 	The state's COVID-19 situation has been covered more by center- and left-rated outlets than by right-rated outlets. Coverage from left- and center-rated sources has often focused on the high case counts, concerns about over-capacity at hospitals, debates over mask mandates in schools, and DeSantis' management of the situation, with some framing him as a poor leader. Some reports from right-rated outlets highlighted a University of South Florida epidemiology professor who predicted Florida's current spike will peak next week, with the possibility of reaching herd immunity in three weeks if vaccination rates improve.
TITLE=> The Aftermath of the Wall Street GameStop Saga.

Robinhood, a popular trading platform, faces 30 lawsuits after allegations that the company breached its contract when it restricted trading of certain stocks; after the surge, Wall Street faces questions about regulation, and whether the social media-driven surge is equal to illegal market manipulation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly searching through social media and message boards for evidence of illegal activity. The Senate Banking Committee announced it will hold its own hearing, but no date has been set yet. GameStop's stock drop and Robinhood's lawsuits were reported on by outlets across the political spectrum.

ARTICLE=> The Mexican government filed a federal lawsuit against 10 U.S. gun manufacturers and distributors on Aug. 4 in Massachusetts federal court, accusing the companies of "actively facilitating" the trafficking of those weapons to "drug cartels and other criminals in Mexico." The Mexican government is seeking up to $10 billion from gun manufacturers, saying at least 17,000 homicides were linked to trafficked weapons in 2019. According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, about 70% of guns found in Mexico and submitted for tracing from 2014 through 2018 originated in the U.S. Mexico has strict laws around gun sales for private use. Given that, some Americans have made a profit by legally purchasing guns and then re-selling them to Mexican trafficking organizations for high prices.  Most voices across the spectrum agreed that the lawsuit would be an uphill battle for the Mexican government. Many left-rated voices believe that the case could help decrease gun violence both in the U.S. and Mexico, arguing that the 2nd Amendment has been protecting these gun manufacturers and that the law needs to be updated. Right-rated voices were more likely to take the stance that the Mexican government is blaming the unchecked crime and corruption in their country on "law-abiding firearm manufacturers" in the U.S.
TITLE=> Trump Says Pentagon Leaders Prolong Wars to Keep Defense Contractors Happy.

Fact-checkers found that while the phrase "under God" was omitted from at least two recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance at individual caucus meetings during the 2020 DNC — the LGBTQ caucus meeting and the Muslim Delegates Assembly — the phrase was included in the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each night. Former Illinois senatorial candidate Peggy Hubbard also said on Facebook that the DNC omitted the words "one nation under God" from the pledge of allegiance. Facebook since flagged Hubbard's post as misinformation as a part of its effort to stop the spread of false news. Trump's tweet comes after the omission was covered by several right-rated outlets earlier in the week. Coverage from right-rated outlets tended to focus on the omission as a whole; coverage from left-rated fact checkers tended to focus on the fact that only two caucuses omitted the phrase.
TITLE=> Derek Chauvin Sentenced to 22.5 Years In Prison For Murder of George Floyd. ARTICLE=> Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted earlier this year of second-degree unintentional murder in the death of George Floyd, was sentenced Friday to 22.5 years in prison. Before the sentence hearing, Floyd's family read impact statements and asked the judge for the maximum sentence for Chauvin; Chauvin also spoke briefly, offered condolences to Floyd's family. Prosecutors asked for a 30-year sentence, arguing that Chauvin's actions "traumatized Mr. Floyd’s family...and his conduct shocked the nation’s conscience.” Chauvin's lawyer asked the court for probation and time served, arguing that placing Chauvin with other inmates may make him a target. Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill delivered the sentence, and said that while the sentence "is not based on emotion or sympathy," he also acknowledged "the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family.” Chauvin will also face federal civil rights charges; the three other officers involved the Floyd's death await a separate manslaughter trial. Chauvin's sentence was widely covered throughout the spectrum. Many outlets focused on the details and history of Chauvin's trial; some outlets recounted how Floyd's death launched a nationwide movement against police brutality and racism. Some outlets on the left highlighted other cases of police shootings; one voice stated that Chauvin's sentencing was a "rare rebuke by the criminal justice system against a police officer who killed someone while on duty." 
TITLE=> Oregon: GOP Lawmakers Dodging Vote. ARTICLE=> This week in Oregon, GOP lawmakers are staying away from the state capitol in order to deny state democrats from achieving quorum. The GOP lawmakers want to prevent the state from passing a key climate change bill, and have threatened not to return until the bill is either taken off the agenda, or until the legislative session lapses. They have been threatened with a $500 fine for every day they do not show up, and Governor Kate Brown has deployed state troopers to round these lawmakers up. A militia group in Oregon known as the Three Percenters, have pledged to provide protection for the fleeing lawmakers. Oregon has 18 democrat senators and 20 are needed to reach quorum. The Oregon legislative session ends on June 30th.
TITLE=> Felons in Florida Regain the Right to Vote.

TITLE=> Release of Some JFK Files. ARTICLE=> U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the unveiling of 2,800 documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy but sided with the FBI and CIA to block the release of other records to be reviewed further.
TITLE=> Extremist Group Involvement in Recent Protests, Violence. ARTICLE=> The extent to which extremist groups have been involved with rioting and protests following the death of George Floyd is the focus of prominent and sometimes divided media coverage. Some coverage from left-rated outlets gave speculation of alt-right groups and white supremacists inciting violence in otherwise peaceful protests. Conversely, right-rated outlets focused more on seeming involvement by extreme left movements, such as antifa, inciting violence at otherwise peaceful protests. President Donald Trump recently said antifa will be declared a domestic terrorist organization. 
TITLE=> Two Men Charged With Assault on Police Officer Brian Sicknick, Who Died After Capitol Breach. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, two men were arrested and charged with assaulting police officer Brian Sicknick, who died shortly after the Jan. 6 Capitol breach. The Justice Department said Monday that Julian Elie Khater, 32, and George Pierre Tanios, 39, each face nine counts related to the Capitol attack, including the assault of Sicknick and two other federal agents with a chemical irritant; the charges carry a maximum of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors did not link Khater and Tanios' attack with Sicknick's death the following day, as the cause of Sicknick's death is still publicly unknown. The Washington Post reported that officials disputed early reporting that Sicknick was killed by blunt force trauma. Capitol police said in a statement on Feb. 26 that the investigation into Sicknick's death is ongoing. The story received wide coverage across the political spectrum; outlets from all sides focused on the details of Sicknick's death and on the charges. The Hill highlighted the fact that House Democrats cited Sicknick’s death in their impeachment case against former President Donald Trump, who was accused of inciting the Capitol breach.
TITLE=> Former CDC Director Voices 'Opinion' That Coronavirus 'Most Likely' Came From Wuhan Lab. ARTICLE=> Former Trump-appointed CDC Director Robert Redfield told CNN it was his “opinion” that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 inadvertently “escaped” from a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. “I’m of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathology in Wuhan was from a laboratory — escaped. Other people don’t believe that. That’s fine. Science will eventually figure it out,” Redfield said. While the origin of the virus has not yet been officially determined, a February analysis by the WHO concluded that the “lab leak” theory was “extremely unlikely.”  Coverage in some left-rated outlets—including CNN, which produced the interview in question—highlighted Redfield’s lack of “clear evidence” for his belief. Coverage in some right-rated outlets seemed to criticize left-rated outlets for doing this.
TITLE=> Perspectives: Concerns About Consumer Inflation. ARTICLE=> Rising consumer prices are spurring concerns and debates nationwide as the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 4.2 percent year over year in April, the fastest increase since September 2008. Prices have risen recently across many sectors, including energy, used automobiles, airlines and hotels. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) reported that in April, the percentage of small-business owners who raised their average prices month over month increased 10 points to 36% in April, the highest point in 40 years. Federal Reserve officials have described the price hikes as a temporary effect of the quickening economic recovery. Outlets on all sides have covered the recent inflation. Coverage from left-rated sources sometimes framed it as less concerning than right-rated sources did, describing the rising prices while also highlighting strategies consumers could use to spend less. Reports from right-rated sources typically painted inflation as more of a dire concern, and focused on the economic shutdown amid the pandemic as a potential cause for price rises. Other coverage highlighted economists who worry that President Joe Biden's ambitious spending plans could increase inflation; investor concerns were also a subject of reports throughout the spectrum.
TITLE=> How Coronavirus is Impacting the 2020 Election.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (DE) has been addressing the public with coronavirus updates through videocasts, at times criticizing President Donald Trump for his purported shortcomings in managing the virus; Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has continued campaigning, sometimes forgoing Senate votes on stimulus packages to hold campaign events. Many right-rated outlets have focused on efforts of the Democratic 'establishment' to change voting rules as part of coronavirus relief legislation.

TITLE=> Michael Cohen Pleads Guilty, Says Trump Directed Him to Break Campaign Finance Law. ARTICLE=> President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight criminal charges, testifying that Trump directed him to break campaign finance law by arranging payments to two women who said they had affairs with then-candidate Trump. Many on the Left say that Cohen's plea is hugely problematic for the president as it implicates him as a co-conspirator. However, some others say that, while the charges are troublesome, they won't necessarily lead to impeachment.
TITLE=> Gorsuch Tapped for Supreme Court.

TITLE=> Perspectives: New Texas Abortion Law. ARTICLE=> Texas' new ban on most abortions, coupled with the Supreme Court's decision not to hear a challenge to the law, has revived sharp divisions on abortion among Americans. In public opinion polls, abortion consistently ranks among America's most divisive issues. The new law bans abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected, which usually takes place six weeks into a pregnancy. The law also bars state officials from enforcing it, and instead authorizes private persons to bring civil action against people who perform or knowingly assist the abortion process. 	News outlets and columnists across the spectrum have highlighted the ban this week. Left- and center-rated voices were often critical of the ban. Many raised concerns about victims of rape and incest not having abortion access; many also accused conservatives of hypocrisy for supporting personal choice on COVID-19 pandemic guidelines but not abortion. Some libertarian voices questioned the ban's constitutionality and its alignment with Supreme Court precedent. Right-rated voices often celebrated the ban, with some praising it for enacting "strong legislative protections for unborn children"; some on the right raised concerns that the ruling could hurt Republican chances in upcoming elections due to the general support among Americans for keeping abortion legal.

TITLE=> US to Begin Evacuating Afghan Allies in Late July. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration will begin evacuation flights in late July for Afghans and their families who helped the U.S., according to an anonymous senior White House official cited by several outlets. They will be sent to locations outside of the U.S. to wait for the State Department to finish processing their special immigrant visas. The news comes a week after President Joe Biden announced that all American troops would be out of Afghanistan by August 31. While the Taliban continues to make advances in the country, leaders from the Afghan government and the Taliban have agreed to meet in Doha, Qatar for peace talks. In an interview with German news outlet Deutsche Welle released Wednesday, former President George W. Bush criticized the Afghanistan withdrawal, saying, “I’m afraid Afghan women and girls are going to suffer unspeakable harm.”  Coverage of the evacuation flights was mostly balanced across the spectrum. Some coverage attributed the flight schedule to Biden himself, rather than the overall Biden administration or the U.S. as a country. 
TITLE=> Big Tech CEOs Face Antitrust Hearing. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, the CEOs of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple appeared in a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives' antitrust subcommittee. Officials interrogated the tech CEOs about alleged predatory business practices, theft of digital content and copying and purchasing of competing businesses. The virtual hearing is a result of 13 months of investigation into the companies' alleged monopolies on the tech industry. During the hearing, Republican officials asked questions about anti-conservative bias, while Democratic officials tended to ask more questions about competitive domination. Officials also asked questions about surveillance and about the Chinese government stealing U.S. technology. Some left- and right-rated outlets tended to highlight some Republican lawmakers' questions on anti-conservative bias. Many outlets from all sides of the political spectrum provided live updates.
TITLE=> Pope Francis Calls for Civil Union Laws for Same-Sex Couples. ARTICLE=> Pope Francis called for the creation of civil union laws for same-sex couples in a new documentary screened at the Rome Film Festival on Wednesday: “What we have to create is a civil union law. That way, they are legally covered. I stood up for that.” Francis also said that "[homosexuals] have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it.” The Catholic church has not indicated any change in its official stance on the issue; current Catholic doctrine under the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith includes strong opposition to civil unions, calling them an “approval of deviant behaviour.”  Coverage in some center- and left-rated outlets focused on activists’ expectations that the pope’s comments would lead to greater acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. Coverage in center- and right-rated outlets tended to distinguish between the pope’s views and the church’s doctrine.
TITLE=> Last US Military Flight Leaves Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> The last U.S. military plane left Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai International Airport Monday, marking the end of America's longest war.  President Joe Biden is expected to address the nation on Tuesday about the decision to withdraw, and about continued diplomatic efforts to assist those who were unable to leave before the pullout. While public opinion polls suggest most Americans support leaving Afghanistan, there has been widespread disapproval over the way the withdrawal was carried out. Some, especially right-rated media outlets, are criticizing Biden for breaking his pledge to stay in Afghanistan until every American was evacuated. The State Department believes there are between 100-200 American citizens still trying to leave Afghanistan.

TITLE=> Journalists Allowed Inside Migrant Detention Facility, Report Overcrowding. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the Biden administration allowed journalists inside its main border detention facility for migrant children for the first time in Donna, Texas, after previously restricting the information that Border Patrol officials were allowed to share with the media. Journalists reported eight "pods," or tent structures, where each were designed to hold 32 migrant children; one tent currently held 615 children. Overall, the space intended for 250 people held 4,000 people. ABC reported that of those, 3,400 were unaccompanied minors. While the Biden administration continues to expel adult migrants who approach the border under a Trump-era COVID-19 safety precaution, Biden declined to continue the practice of expelling unaccompanied children. Migrants are held in tents before being taken to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services, and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor. CBS reported that facility operations are supposed to cost $6 million each month for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); however, because of overcrowding, CBP is spending $16 million per month. The story received coverage across the political spectrum. Outlets on all sides of the spectrum also provided analysis of the complications at the border; some right- and center-rated outlets highlighted Republican criticism of Biden's immigration policy, comparing his policy to that of former President Donald Trump's.
TITLE=> Trump Suggests Delaying November Election, Citing Voter Fraud Concerns. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that the November election should be delayed, arguing that voting by mail poses a grave risk to election security. Coverage from many left-rated outlets cited the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress the power to delay an election or fill a void if a president or vice president fail to qualify. Some speculated that this role could be temporarily filled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) if needed; Pelosi is also on the ballot, but only in her district. Many left-rated voices and some right-rated voices were critical of the suggestion; coverage on both sides explored the president's potential power to delay the election, with coverage from left-rated outlets generally framing Trump's comments as ignorant.
TITLE=> White House Aide To Testify On Trump Ukraine Dealings. ARTICLE=> Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the director of European Affairs on the National Security Council, is being deposed by House investigators Tuesday.

TITLE=> Biden Holds CNN Town Hall in Battleground State Pennsylvania. ARTICLE=> CNN hosted a town hall with Joe Biden near his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania on Thursday evening. Moderated by CNN host Anderson Cooper, the socially-distanced town hall took questions from voters in the battleground state. A wide range of topics were covered during the event, including the COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine, public attitude toward coronavirus public health measures, the economy and stock market, immigration and healthcare. Biden criticized Trump's handling of the pandemic and clarified his position on a mask mandate; he also called for accountability in police departments and reiterated his condemnation of violence. Coverage from all sides of the political spectrum tended to focus on Biden's comments and his stances on each topic covered, often providing analysis and perspective. Some right-rated outlets compared Biden's CNN town hall to President Donald Trump's ABC town hall earlier this week, saying that CNN asked Biden "softball questions."

TITLE=> Congressional Primary Elections in Ohio Test Progressive Influence, Trump Clout. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, two special Congressional primary elections in Ohio will test the influence of progressive Democrats and the clout of former President Donald Trump.  In the traditionally-Democratic 11th District, which includes Cleveland and Akron, Democrat Nina Turner is in a tight race, and is backed by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).  In the traditionally Republican 15th District south of Columbus, Trump is supporting Republican coal lobbyist Mike Carey.

TITLE=> Weekly Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest Level Since March 2020. ARTICLE=> The Labor Department (DOL) reported Thursday that U.S. jobless claims fell to 293,000 last week, a decrease of 36,000 from the previous week's revised level and the lowest number of initial jobless claims since March 2020. The number contradicts the September jobs report, which showed the slowest job growth so far this year. According to Thursday's report, California and Michigan were the only states with over 3,000 more initial claims than the previous week. The number of new claims fell by over 1,000 in Florida, Tennessee and Texas. 	Coverage across the spectrum suggested that the report indicates companies are trying hard to retain current workers. Many contrasted the seemingly positive data with recent reports indicating a more unstable economy, such as the September jobs report and a Bureau of Labor Statistics report that says a record number of people quit their jobs in August. Left- and right-rated outlets both quoted an economist from Navy Federal Credit Union who called Thursday's report "the strongest evidence yet that the Covid-19 delta wave has lost its influence on layoffs."

ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the Republican National Convention events scheduled to take place in-person in Jacksonville, Fla. next month, would not be held. The president cited COVID-19 coronavirus concerns in the area as the primary reason for the cancellation. Some left-rated voices described the move as inevitable, framing the president's management of campaign events as incompetent. Others focused on how cancelling his in-person nomination acceptance speech may have a negative effect on his reelection chances. Coverage from right-rated outlets focused more generally on the announcement, with some highlighting Trump's emphasis on protecting potential attendees; others focused on inner GOP discussions about campaign planning.
TITLE=> Trump's Name Will Appear on Stimulus Checks. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's name is reportedly set to appear on the $1,200 stimulus checks being mailed to certain Americans. He initially suggested the idea to the U.S. Treasury Department, which reportedly then made the decision to print the name on the checks. Senior officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expect the move to cause delays in mailing; the Treasury maintains that no delays will occur. Left-rated news outlets tended to accentuate claims by the IRS officials. Right-rated sources focused more on the Treasury's claims, with some outlets using them as the basis for fact checks.

TITLE=> Boy Scouts to Change Name and Allow Girls to Enroll. ARTICLE=> The Boy Scouts of America announced that they will change the name of their flagship program from "Boy Scouts" to "Scouts BSA" after revealing that they will accept female scouts starting in 2019.

TITLE=> U.S. Coronavirus-Related Death Count Reaches 600,000. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, the total count of COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S. reached 600,000, the highest recorded death toll in the world, according to the New York Times. Data from Johns Hopkins University, however, shows that the COVID-19 death toll has been slowing for months — from an average of 3,000 daily deaths in January to an average of 360 as of Sunday — as 44% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated and the White House pushes to vaccinate 70% of all Americans by July 4. On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated as the country approached the "sad milestone" of 600,000  COVID-related deaths. This comes as many states, including New York and California, relax their pandemic safety measures this month.  The story received wide coverage from across the political spectrum. Coverage from some left-rated outlets tended to frame the 600,000 deaths as occuring "despite" the vaccine push in their headlines; some right-rated outlets highlighted the decline in weekly death averages. 
TITLE=> Bombing Near Kabul Mosque Marks First Major Attack Since US Withdrawal. ARTICLE=> A bomb that exploded near the entrance of Kabul's main mosque on Sunday afternoon has killed at least eight people and left dozens wounded, according to medical sources in Afghanistan. The bombing marks the first major attack since the Kabul airport bombing that killed 13 U.S. troops in August. The blast targeted the Eid Gah Mosque where a funeral prayer service was being held for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Some outlets emphasized how the explosion "underlined the serious security challenges" that the Taliban has faced since Western forces retreated from Afghanistan in August. Most left-and-center rated sources noted three people were arrested at the scene of the bombing but no group has taken responsibility. Some right-rated sources such as the Daily Mail said "responsibility for the attack was claimed by IS-K," noting how "attacks against the Taliban by IS militants have increased since the Taliban swept to power in mid-August."
TITLE=> Asked About Peaceful Transition of Power, Trump Says 'We're Gonna Have to See What Happens'. ARTICLE=> On Wednesday, a reporter asked President Donald Trump: "Will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transferral of power after the election?" Trump responded: "We're going to have to see what happens, you know that. I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster." When the reporter asked again, Trump said: "Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful — there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation." Coverage in many left- and center-rated sources described Trump's comments as a "refusal" to commit to a peaceful transition of power. Some coverage from right-rated outlets focused on Trump's concerns about mail-in ballots and election integrity. Many reports on all sides also focused on Republican lawmakers' responses to the comments, with some coverage in left-rated outlets saying Republicans “downplayed” or “brushed aside” Trump’s comments.

TITLE=> US Drone Strike Kills Two ISIS-K Members Following Kabul Airport Bombing. ARTICLE=> A U.S. military drone strike killed two “high profile” Islamic State militants and injured another on Friday night in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, according to the Pentagon. The attack was conducted in response to the suicide bombing at the airport in Kabul, which killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 other people. During a Pentagon press conference on Saturday morning, Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor described the targets killed as “facilitators” and “planners.” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the names of the drone strike targets nor their involvement in the attack would be released. It was also stated that the strike killed no civilians. ISIS-K, otherwise known as the Islamic State-Khorasan, previously claimed responsibility for Thursday's suicide bombing.  The news was prominently covered across the spectrum. Left-rated outlets were more likely to highlight how the Pentagon acknowledged the possibility that some of the people that died during the bombing may have been killed in gunfire by American service members after the explosion. Right- and center-rated outlets were more likely to mention that an ISIS-K commander told CNN's Clarissa Ward that the terrorist group was planning the strike for over two weeks; many on the right also focused on and mourned the fallen Americans soldiers.
TITLE=> Biden Plans Executive Order After Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order strengthening cybersecurity for federal agencies and contractors after last week's hacking of the Colonial Pipeline, the nation's largest refined pipeline system .
