Then along came Trump, the man who made his political career and presidency from statements and promises that violated every piece of advice in the GOP pandering and sensitivity training handbook. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden is struggling to win Miami Latinos, new poll finds. Will it cost him Florida?. ARTICLE=> Four years after getting trounced in Miami-Dade County by Hillary Clinton, President Donald Trump has increased his odds of victory in his must-win home state on Nov. 3 by improving his standing in Florida’s most populous county, according to a poll by Bendixen & Amandi International and the Miami Herald. The poll of 500 likely Miami-Dade voters, released Tuesday, found Trump far behind Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden 38% to 55% in Miami-Dade, where Democrats typically need to run up the score in order to compete in statewide races. [SEP] TITLE=> Democrats fear Biden's lagging Latino support could cost him. ARTICLE=> Democrats are worried that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lagging support among Latino voters could put him at risk of losing Florida, and even the White House, in November. Recent polls out of Florida show the former vice president’s support among Latinos trailing Hillary Clinton’s in 2016, fueling concerns that he could lose a pivotal swing state. “There’s really no good answer here if you’re the Biden campaign,” one Florida Democratic operative said.
TITLE=> Benjamin Netanyahu’s reckoning a sour ending for a transformative prime minister. ARTICLE=> Benjamin Netanyahu showed the opposite of grace as he exited from power on Sunday. If you want to evaluate his legacy on the basis of his final day in office, you will mark him down as one of history’s sorest losers. [SEP] TITLE=> More Unites the Parties of Israel's New Government than Divides Them. ARTICLE=> Anew Israeli government has been sworn in. This new government does not include former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his Likud Party, which has ruled Israel with few exceptions for the last 44 years. And both Bibi's supporters and his opponents will need to adjust to a whole new world in which, to paraphrase President Richard Nixon, they won't have Netanyahu to kick around anymore. The question remains as to how long this new world will exist. Many pundits predict a quick demise of the new government. [SEP] TITLE=> Netanyahu, ‘King of Israel,’ Exits a Stage He Dominated. ARTICLE=> Israel’s longest-serving prime minister was a polarizing figure who sidelined efforts to resolve the Palestinian conflict but opened relations with four Arab countries. He came to power like some conqueror from a distant land called Philadelphia. Educated in the United States, speaking flawless East Coast English, warning in pungent sound bites about the threats posed by Islamic terrorism and a nuclear Iran, the Benjamin Netanyahu who stormed into Israeli politics in the 1990s was like no other politician the country had seen.
TITLE=> Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson emerges as State Department frontrunner. ARTICLE=> President-elect Donald Trump is zeroing in on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of State nominee.

TITLE=> Schumer joins call for immediate removal and impeachment of Trump following Capitol siege. ARTICLE=> Sen. Chuck Schumer, who will become the majority leader within a few weeks, called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Trump from office. He said Congress should also impeach the president. Schumer, a New York Democrat, joined a growing list of Democrats who say Trump should not be in office a minute longer following a violent and deadly siege of the Capitol on Wednesday that they blame on him. [SEP] TITLE=> Pelosi calls for Trump’s immediate removal from office after deadly riots. ARTICLE=> Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to immediately remove President Donald Trump from office following the deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol. "If the vice president and the Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment," Pelosi said. [SEP] TITLE=> House Judiciary Committee Democrats urge Pence to invoke 25th Amendment. ARTICLE=> House Judiciary Committee Democrats called on Vice President Mike Pence in a letter Wednesday to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Trump from office, saying he incited the riot that violently breached the U.S. Capitol earlier that day. Why it matters: The letter comes as Republican officials are considering drastic steps to stop the president, including censure, impeachment or invoking the 25th Amendment, which would allow Pence to step in if Trump were found to be unable to perform his duties, Axios' Jonathan Swan and Margaret Talev report.
TITLE=> Latino groups warn that Biden’s sluggish outreach to their voters could hurt in November. ARTICLE=> Top Latino Democrats are voicing growing concern about Joe Biden’s campaign, warning that lackluster efforts to win the support of their community could have devastating consequences in the November election. Recent polls showing President Trump’s inroads with Latinos have set off a fresh round of frustration and finger-pointing among Democrats, confirming problems some say have simmered for months. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump campaign courts Latino voters in Arizona, historically Democrats. Here's what that looks like. ARTICLE=> In a south Phoenix strip mall near a Chinese restaurant and cell phone store, sits a new office designed to mobilize Latino voters and convince them to vote for President Donald Trump in November. Outside the front doors, the words "Latinos for Trump" are written in chalk on the sidewalk. The windows of Latinos for Trump are adorned with photos of Latinos and core values the Trump campaign believes will attract this group of voters: faith, family, opportunity. [SEP] TITLE=> Why Trump Is Winning Over Hispanics. ARTICLE=> It’s ‘showing up,’ says Florida senator Rick Scott. Florida senator Rick Scott has an advanced degree in winning Hispanic voters as a Republican. It has buoyed him in all his races, most recently his victory in his 2018 Senate race after serving two terms as governor, so he seems a logical person to ask about President Donald Trump’s eye-popping improvement among Hispanics in Florida. A Marist/NBC poll last week had Trump narrowly ahead of Biden among Hispanics in Florida, and the president is leading handily among Cuban Americans.
TITLE=> No, Biden’s new border move isn’t like Trump’s ‘kids in cages’. ARTICLE=> For as long as former president Donald Trump’s highly controversial policies on children at the U.S.-Mexico border have been at issue, there have been allegations of hypocrisy leveled against critics of those policies. Democrats accused Trump of putting “kids in cages,” so Trump and his defenders pointed out that the chain-link partitions were built by the Obama administration. Democrats decried the separation of children from their families, so Trump defenders pointed out this happened sometimes under Barack Obama, too. Both of those allegations of hypocrisy were vastly oversimplified. [SEP] TITLE=> WaPo called out for report on Biden's 'migrant facility for children' after hitting Trump's 'kids in cages'. ARTICLE=> The Washington Post raised eyebrows on Monday night for a report on the first newly opened "migrant facility for children" under President Biden, which critics compared to the "kids in cages" mantra that was pushed during the Trump administration. "Dozens of migrant teens boarded vans Monday for the trip down a dusty road to a former man camp for oil field workers here, the first migrant child facility opened under the Biden administration," the Post reported from Carrizo Springs, Texas. [SEP] TITLE=> US reopens Texas surge facility to hold immigrant teenagers. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden’s administration has reopened a tent facility to house up to 700 immigrant teenagers after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied by a parent, a sign of growing worries about how children are treated in government custody. U.S. Health and Human Services said Monday that the first teens arrived at Carrizo Springs, Texas, which was converted two years ago into a holding facility under former President Donald Trump. The facility has been closed since July 2019.
TITLE=> Marriot, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Commerce Bank suspend donations to lawmakers who objected to certifying Electoral College vote. ARTICLE=> In the wake of the violent attack on Capitol Hill last week, at least three corporations have announced that they would suspend contributions to the campaigns of lawmakers who objected to the certification of Electoral College votes. At least four protests were scheduled in Washington, D.C., for Wednesday, the day Congress was expected to count the votes of the Electoral College and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Those protests descended into chaos as demonstrators breached the congressional building — smashing windows, breaking into offices, and looting rooms. [SEP] TITLE=> Facebook freezing political spending after Capitol attack. ARTICLE=> Facebook is halting political spending for at least the first quarter of 2021 following last week's deadly attack on the Capitol. Why it matters: Tech companies have been de-platforming President Donald Trump and his supporters at a rapid pace since the attacks, and freezing political giving may be the next step tech companies take to show they're seriously rethinking their approach to Washington. Details: Facebook will freeze all contributions from its political action committee and is launching a review of its political spending practices, company spokesman Andy Stone told Axios. [SEP] TITLE=> Wall Street Rethinks Campaign Contributions in Wake of Violence. ARTICLE=> For years Wall Street has sprinkled money all across U.S. politics to make and keep friends in Washington. Now, it’s rethinking the consequences. After the deadly siege on Capitol Hill last week, major banks are reassessing, reducing and in many cases suspending their campaign contributions. Some are vowing to pull back from candidates who appeared to support the attempted insurrection. The moves represent a sharp break with the past and come as leaders across corporate America are rushing to distance themselves from President Donald Trump.
TITLE=> Protesters clash with Minneapolis police after George Floyd’s death. ARTICLE=> Chaos broke out on Tuesday night in Minneapolis as protesters took to the streets to demand action after the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died in police custody a day earlier. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades on some protesters, reports said. The protest started peacefully, but the situation deteriorated and some demonstrators were seen breaking windows of police cars and hurling rocks, reports said. [SEP] TITLE=> Bystander Videos of George Floyd and Others Are Policing the Police. ARTICLE=> The Minneapolis police statement was short and sanitized. An allegation of forgery. A suspect who “appeared to be under the influence,” who “physically resisted officers” and who appeared to be “suffering medical distress.” The video that emerged hours later told a drastically different story. It showed a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black suspect until he appeared limp and unconscious. Throughout the encounter, the man, George Floyd, could be heard saying “I can’t breathe” again and again. He later died at a hospital. [SEP] TITLE=> Swift firings for Minneapolis officers in death of black man. ARTICLE=> MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd’s death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor’s full backing.

ARTICLE=> The White House said Friday evening that President Trump misunderstood the question when he blasted Republican leaders’ immigration bill, and insisted he really does support the compromise plan that just hours earlier he said he “wouldn’t sign.” [SEP] TITLE=> White House walks back Trump's rejection of immigration compromise. ARTICLE=> President Trump in fact supports both of the House GOP immigration bills expected to receive votes next week and misspoke earlier Friday when he said that he would oppose a compromise measure between centrists and conservatives, a White House official told The Hill.
TITLE=> Congress has officially passed a $900 billion Covid-19 relief package. ARTICLE=> Days before the holidays, Congress has passed a $900 billion bill to extend unemployment insurance, pay out additional stimulus checks to Americans and provide more loans for small businesses. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed the relief bill Monday night on a vote of 359-53, just hours after the final legislative text was released to members. A few hours later, the Republican-controlled US Senate did the same with a vote of 92-6. [SEP] TITLE=> House, Senate pass COVID-19 relief bill, which now heads to Trump's desk. ARTICLE=> Democrats and Republicans linked arms Monday and rushed to pass a new round of coronavirus relief, saying they were delivering a measure of hope to families grimly confronting the holidays and new year amid a new round of shutdowns. The bill, which also included full funding for all other government operations in 2021, cleared both chambers with strong bipartisan support late Monday night. It now needs to be signed into law by President Trump. [SEP] TITLE=> Congress Passes Covid-19 Relief, Spending Package With Overwhelming Support. ARTICLE=> Congress overwhelmingly approved $900 billion of relief for households and businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic, passing an emergency measure aimed at buoying the country through a difficult winter and into a new year. The bill now heads to the White House, where President Trump is expected to sign it into law.

TITLE=> US Democrats turn to Nevada to clarify a chaotic campaign. ARTICLE=> The muddled race to secure the Democratic nomination for US president enters a new phase this weekend as voters in the western state of Nevada gather to show their preference for one of the seven candidates still in the race. With two contests behind them, the candidates fanned out across the state ahead of the vote in an effort to convince caucus-goers that they were best suited to take on President Donald Trump in the November general election. [SEP] TITLE=> Sanders aims for Nevada caucus win to keep momentum going -- but other Dems not giving up. ARTICLE=> LAS VEGAS – The White House race has moved west to Nevada, where the electorate is much more diverse, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is aiming for the same result -- a repeat performance of his victory in last week’s New Hampshire primary. [SEP] TITLE=> 26 Scenarios For What Things Could Look Like After Nevada. ARTICLE=> The results in Nevada will likely have a meaningful effect on the overall race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Coming into Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders is a strong favorite to win Nevada — FiveThirtyEight’s forecast gives him about a 6 in 7 chance of finishing first there. But how much he wins by — or whether he wins at all — will also affect what the race looks like coming out of the Silver State.

ARTICLE=> China’s finance ministry announced on Monday evening that it was raising tariffs on a wide range of American goods to 20 percent or 25 percent from 10 percent, in the first Chinese move to retaliate over President Trump’s broader increase in tariffs on Chinese goods last Friday. But the finance ministry delayed the implementation of its tariff increase until June 1, a delay of nearly three weeks that allows time for negotiators to make one last push for a deal.
TITLE=> Border Patrol Agent Offers to Give Ocasio-Cortez a Personal Tour of Detention Facility After 'Disgusting' Holocaust Comparison. ARTICLE=> The vice president of the National Border Patrol Council extended Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a personal invitation to tour a detention facility after she claimed that the U.S. government is “running concentration camps on our southern border” to hold illegal immigrants. “She needs to come down here, I’ll offer to show her myself the area,” Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council and a Border Patrol agent, told Bill Hemmer Tuesday while appearing on “America’s Newsroom.” [SEP] TITLE=> Republicans Claim Outrage Over Ocasio-Cortez’s “Concentration Camps” Remarks. ARTICLE=> Republicans are claiming outrage after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) compared immigration detention centers along the southern border to concentration camps—remarks she first made during an Instagram Live session late Monday and has since defended. “That is exactly what they are: They are concentration camps,” Ocasio-Cortez told her followers on Monday. “I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that ‘never again’ means something.” [SEP] TITLE=> Ocasio-Cortez under fire for concentration camp remarks.

TITLE=> Georgia Governor Brian Kemp Protects Public Health By Nixing Local Mask Requirements. ARTICLE=> Yesterday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp issued an Executive Order striking down mask requirements in at least fifteen local jurisdictions. While the governor has encouraged Georgians to mask up to prevent the spread of coronavirus, he has called mandates “a bridge too far.” So despite growing evidence that masks work, and Kemp’s own exhortation that people should mask up if they want to watch college football this fall, the newest order explicitly makes them optional. [SEP] TITLE=> Georgia Governor Bans Cities, Counties from Requiring Masks. ARTICLE=> Georgia governor Brian Kemp issued an executive order Wednesday overruling mask mandates put in place by local governments in the state to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, calling such rules “unenforceable.” Kemp’s order, which extended the state’s COVID-19 restrictions through July 31, prohibits local municipalities from enforcing mandatory mask orders that are more restrictive than his statewide order that only encourages face coverings, effectively voiding orders issued by at least 15 local governments across the state, NPR reported. [SEP] TITLE=> Georgia's Governor Issues Order Rescinding Local Mask Mandates. ARTICLE=> Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is overruling local government mandates requiring people to wear masks in public to stop the spread of COVID-19, insisting that the state's less-stringent guidelines take precedence. Kemp on Wednesday extended the state's COVID-19 restrictions, which strongly encourage the wearing of masks, but stopped short of requiring them in public, calling such a measure "a bridge too far."
TITLE=> Trump decries ‘cancel culture’ — but no one embraces it more. ARTICLE=> In a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day, President Trump railed against “cancel culture” and the left’s supposed wholesale embrace of totalitarianism (err, “toe-tally-terrio-tism”). He accused his political opponents of “shaming dissenters and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees,” arguing that such behavior has “absolutely no place in the United States of America.” Unfortunately, no other American has spent more time, energy and (taxpayer) resources trying to cancel dissent and enforce submission than Trump. [SEP] TITLE=> To stop ‘cancel culture,’ protect people’s viewpoints under civil rights law. ARTICLE=> An epidemic of workplace discrimination is sweeping the United States. It threatens not only people’s jobs and livelihoods, but the very structure of our civic life. It calls out for an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The victims aren’t targeted over their race, sex, sexual orientation or even gender identity (that last category now being recognized as covered under the act by a recent decision of the Supreme Court). All those groups already have protection. [SEP] TITLE=> Cancel culture: What unites young people against Obama and Trump. ARTICLE=> "Cancel culture", the term for when individuals or companies face swift public backlash and boycott over offensive statements or actions, has been an incendiary topic in the movements of recent years, whether relating to misogyny, race or homophobia. To some, it's a new way to flag past wrongs. To others, it's an ineffective over-reaction in the court of public opinion. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, some see the dethroning of historical figures associated with racism as the latest iteration of cancel culture.
TITLE=> This Is What Making History Looks Like. ARTICLE=> Forty-four presidents have been elected in the United States over the past 228 years. Not once have voters had the option to choose a female candidate in a major party. Until this cycle. [SEP] TITLE=> Hillary Clinton’s Time Arrives, but Are the Times Right for Her?.

TITLE=> Democrats' next political high-wire act: Selling their $3.5T budget deal. ARTICLE=> Top Senate Democrats are finally in array on a $3.5 trillion price tag for their party's momentous social spending plans. Their next task will be even tougher: selling it to the rest of their party.

[SEP] TITLE=> U.S. Senate Democrats agree to $3.5 trln for budget reconciliation bill. ARTICLE=> U.S. President Joe Biden's drive for big new infrastructure investment got a boost on Tuesday when leading Senate Democrats agreed on a $3.5 trillion investment plan they aim to include in a budget resolution to be debated soon, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Schumer announced Tuesday a tentative framework for a $3.5 trillion party-line social welfare package, although it remains to be seen whether Democrats can unite behind the measure. Mr. Schumer announced the deal after meeting with all 11 Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee. The panel will be responsible for shepherding the deal through the budget reconciliation process, which allows spending bills to pass via a simple majority of 51 votes in the evenly split Senate.
TITLE=> How Inflation Threatens the Recovery. ARTICLE=> There are two kinds of inflation. One results from demand growing faster than the economy’s productive capacity, causing the economy to overheat. Call that good inflation, because it is usually linked to a stronger economy. By contrast, bad inflation results from constricted supply which curtails output, driving up prices and eroding incomes, leading to a weaker economy. Much of the debate over inflation is whether the good sort—i.e., overheating—is about to happen. But investors are signaling that the bad sort is the bigger risk to the economy. [SEP] TITLE=> For Democrats, the pain of inflation is no reason to stop spending. ARTICLE=> Inflation doesn't matter. That's the message Democratic leaders are sending as they try to push more than $4 trillion into the economy to build infrastructure, fight climate change and ease the financial cost of child and elder care for families. [SEP] TITLE=> Dems Dismiss Inflation Fears. ARTICLE=> President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats are dismissing concerns over skyrocketing inflation, saying trillions of dollars on social programs and alternative energy projects should be passed regardless of the price tag. Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) said Monday a "serious inflation problem" would not change his party's plan to push forward with a multitrillion-dollar spending package. The Democrat argued that voters would rather fight climate change than address rising consumer prices.

During a marathon three-hour interview with CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan wanted to make it clear to both Gupta and his audience that he is not actually anti-vaccine.

ARTICLE=> CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta admitted to podcast host Joe Rogan Wednesday that it was improper for the network to claim Rogan took "horse dewormer" as a COVID treatment. On Wednesday's installment of "The Joe Rogan Experience," Rogan grilled the doctor on why someone like him who already had COVID and has antibodies should get vaccinated. "By the way, I'm glad you're better," Gupta said. "Thank you," Rogan responded. "You're probably the only one at CNN who's glad … The rest of them are all lying about me taking horse medication."
TITLE=> The social-distancing deniers have arrived. ARTICLE=> (CNN) - Patience is in ever-shorter supply. No one is happy with the current situation. But some Americans see the yoke of oppression in public health efforts to keep people home, and they're growing louder. Underneath the general frustration and dazed acceptance of so much of the world changing its lifestyle for the time being lurks a growing defiance of the science that tells us how to deal with Covid-19 and the government that is telling everyone (to varying degrees) to stay indoors. [SEP] TITLE=> Pro-Trump protesters push back on stay-at-home orders. ARTICLE=> While many Americans are filled with fear, Melissa Ackison says the coronavirus pandemic has filled her with anger. The stay-at-home orders are government overreach, the conservative Ohio state Senate candidate says, and the labeling of some workers as “essential” arbitrary. “It enrages something inside of you,” said Ackison, who was among those who protested Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s orders at the statehouse in Columbus with her 10-year-old son. She has “no fear whatsoever” of contracting the virus, she said Thursday, dismissing it as hype.

TITLE=> Why those ICE raids are being announced in advance. ARTICLE=> Starting Sunday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expected to resume its previously announced plan to apprehend thousands of illegal immigrants across the country. The reinvigorated effort comes just weeks after President Trump tweeted that ICE was preparing to kick off days of raids in at least 10 major cities. The operation was halted, however, the day before it was set to start, to give Congress time to arrive at a legislative solution on immigration. [SEP] TITLE=> ICE raids are looming. Panicked immigrants are skipping work, hiding out and bracing for the worst. ARTICLE=> Weeks ago, as President Donald Trump warned that ICE agents were preparing raids across the country, a 41-year-old housekeeper and babysitter in Miami headed to the grocery store with her daughter. They knew they'd be staying inside and needed to stock up on supplies. "I felt that day like it was a hurricane coming," the undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua told CNN. Since then, the raids Trump threatened haven't happened. But for millions of undocumented immigrants living across the United States, the storm is still brewing. [SEP] TITLE=> ICE to Launch Roundup of Undocumented Immigrants Sunday.

ARTICLE=> (CNN)US President Donald Trump says he ordered the assassination on Friday of Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani, "to stop a war." But that's simply not true.

At the heart of this sprawling violent network stood Soleimani. [SEP] TITLE=> Yes, Obama Helped Fund the Iranian Regime.

Biden won all four states. [SEP] TITLE=> Texas AG Paxton Files Election Suit Against 4 Battleground States. ARTICLE=> Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed suit on Tuesday against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, claiming the four states exploited the pandemic to justify ignoring election laws.

TITLE=> Timeline: How the Wuhan lab-leak theory suddenly became credible. ARTICLE=> The source of the coronavirus that has left more than 3 million people dead around the world remains a mystery. But in recent months the idea that it emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) — once dismissed as a ridiculous conspiracy theory — has gained new credence. How and why did this happen? For one, efforts to discover a natural source of the virus have failed. Second, early efforts to spotlight a lab leak often got mixed up with speculation that the virus was deliberately created as a bioweapon. [SEP] TITLE=> With Trump Out of White House, Media Suddenly Finds ‘Lab Leak Theory’ Plausible. ARTICLE=> Former President Donald Trump is known for a lot of things, but one of his special powers is his ability to make the entire corporate media act in concert to bring embarrassment upon themselves. For nearly a year, almost every major news outlet declared that it was a debunked, fringe conspiracy theory to even discuss the idea that the coronavirus pandemic began as a leak from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. [SEP] TITLE=> Media face hard questions on Trump, Wuhan lab. ARTICLE=> The media face hard questions amid a growing acceptance that it is possible COVID-19 originated in a Chinese laboratory. The idea was disparaged as a conspiracy theory by multiple outlets last year - almost surely because its loudest promoter was then-President Trump. Now, as uncertainty grows, there are burgeoning suspicions that the media overstepped their mark. For conservatives and some media critics, that's part of the larger issue of bias.
TITLE=> It’s ‘Home Alone, the Pandemic Version’. ARTICLE=> One Christmas long ago when I was a college student far from my family, I couldn’t afford to fly home.

[SEP] TITLE=> This Christmas, in a year full of despair, we need to hold fast to this truth. ARTICLE=> As we approach the end of 2020, our nation’s mental health is the worst it has been in decades. That’s not my opinion — it’s the findings of a recent report from Gallup, which has asked Americans about the state of their mental health since 2001. This year, nearly one-fourth of Americans rated their mental health as "fair" or "poor," the most significant decline in our country’s psychological well being on record. The sad truth is these findings won’t surprise anyone who has lived through 2020. [SEP] TITLE=> Presence, not presents: Finding meaning in a minimalist Christmas. ARTICLE=> Katherine May loves winter, from the cozy comforts of being indoors to the “blustery outdoor stuff.” But she is no great fan of Christmas – or at least the busywork that starts two months ahead of Dec. 25 and leaves her depleted before it even arrives. “I’m quite well known in my family for opening my Christmas cards standing over the recycling bin and just throwing them in,” she says.

[SEP] TITLE=> In Submarine Deal With Australia, U.S. Counters China but Enrages France. ARTICLE=> President Biden’s announcement this week of a deal to help Australia deploy nuclear-powered submarines has strained the Western alliance, infuriating France and foreshadowing how the conflicting American and European responses to confrontation with China may redraw the global strategic map. In announcing the deal on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said it was meant to reinforce alliances and update them as strategic priorities shift. But in drawing a Pacific ally closer to meet the China challenge, he appears to have alienated an important European one and aggravated already tense relations with Beijing.

[SEP] TITLE=> The third person on tonight’s debate stage might be the most important. So who is Kristen Welker?. ARTICLE=> NBC News’ Kristen Welker will moderate tonight’s debate. Her name has been in the news a lot the past few days, mostly because President Donald Trump keeps running her down, calling her “terrible” and “totally partisan.” But she’s a well-respected journalist, even earning praise from Trump adviser Jason Miller, who called her “very fair.” She is especially well respected inside NBC News.

TITLE=> Biden warns of 'unconstitutional chaos' due to Texas abortion ban. ARTICLE=> A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause "unconstitutional chaos" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday. The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden slams Supreme Court Texas abortion ruling as 'unprecedented assault on a woman’s constitutional rights’. ARTICLE=> President Biden on Thursday slammed the Supreme Court’s overnight ruling to allow Texas' "extreme" law that bans most abortions to remain in effect as an "unprecedented assault on a woman’s constitutional rights." In a strongly worded statement Thursday, the president reacted to the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling to allow Texas’ law to remain in effect. The law, signed by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden launches federal effort to respond to Texas law as he faces pressure to protect abortion. ARTICLE=> A new Texas law that effectively bans most abortions prompted President Joe Biden on Wednesday to use a word he'd entirely avoided as president: "Abortion." The absence of the word in Biden's public remarks and statements has frustrated activists, who say it reflects an issue that fell off the priority list even as women's right to an abortion comes under threat in states across the Midwest and South. The Supreme Court on Wednesday night formally denied a request from Texas abortion providers to freeze the state law, meaning it will remain on the books for now.

[SEP] TITLE=> The fine print in the major DACA decision is a doozy. ARTICLE=> On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined—that is, blocked—Trump’s attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance—or the merits—of the challenge to Trump’s plan to terminate DACA. The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA’s backers are likely to prevail. The bad news is that the injunction isn’t complete.

TITLE=> This July 4th, let’s come together over Trump’s tweets. ARTICLE=> Not so long ago, you could start a real family Fourth of July squabble by debating what should go into coleslaw or what makes a proper barbecue. But now our divisions are far more serious. Majorities of both parties feel tone and civility are getting worse. More Americans are hostile toward their opposing party than ever in history.

TITLE=> The Most Brazen Trick Trump Tried to Pull on His Taxes. ARTICLE=> The explosive New York Times report on Donald Trump’s tax returns confirms a great number of things about the president’s finances we’ve only been able to speculate about for years. We now know that Trump really was telling the truth when he claimed, beginning in the 2016 presidential campaign, that he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (though such an audit would not prevent him from releasing his returns—that part he really did make up). [SEP] TITLE=> How Trump’s Tax Returns Could Affect The Election. ARTICLE=> On Sunday, a New York Times exposé on President Trump’s tax returns revealed decades of tax avoidance and millions of dollars in business losses over the past two decades. The picture painted by Trump’s returns is sharply at odds with the shrewd, deal-making image the president has tried to fashion as a real estate mogul and TV star on a show built around his business prowess, “The Apprentice.” Now, five weeks from Election Day, the question is will these new revelations affect the presidential race? [SEP] TITLE=> Trump's tax returns aren't out of the ordinary. ARTICLE=> The New York Times really needs to get its complaint straight. Apparently, President Trump is a no-good businessman who never makes any money, and so he aggressively avoids tax payments, paying just $750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017 (if the report is true, which Trump has unsurprisingly called "fake news"). No doubt, he has to be aggressive to ensure he doesn't pay taxes on money he hasn't made. Or maybe it's all just another reason to stand in Midtown Manhattan shrieking about Trump.

Moderate Democrats watched in horror as Bernie Sanders soared to a landslide victory in Nevada.

Bernie Sanders are reaching a boiling point as the democratic socialist cemented his front-runner status for the party's 2020 presidential nomination. Ahead of his decisive victory in the Nevada caucuses, Sanders tweeted out a message that has been a central theme in his campaign: "I've got news for the Republican establishment. I've got news for the Democratic establishment. They can't stop us." [SEP] TITLE=> The evidence doesn't back Democrats' panic that Bernie can't win. ARTICLE=> Lots of Democrats are in full panic that Bernie Sanders will win the nomination and get clobbered in the general election — and bring the party down, too. But the evidence, particularly the polling, doesn't back those doomsday warnings. Why it matters: Virtually every national and swing state poll shows Sanders tied with or beating President Trump. And, unlike every rival, he has a huge base of fervent, unshakable supporters he can only grow.

TITLE=> Workers deserve a day in their honor. The unions that exploit them don’t. ARTICLE=> Labor Day was never intended as an homage to the organized labor movement. Unions, of course, vehemently disagree, and while the overwhelming majority of people have come to regard the holiday as nothing more meaningful than a three-day weekend commemorating the end of summer, labor leaders continue to delude themselves that the event somehow validates their dubious ideals and shady tactics.

TITLE=> The US military needs to do more than apologize for its deadly 'mistake' in Kabul. ARTICLE=> On August 29, a US drone strike killed 10 members of one family in Kabul. That same day, the Pentagon announced that the operation successfully targeted a suicide bomber affiliated with ISIS-K, who had allegedly filled a car with explosives as part of a suspected plan to attack the Hamid Karzai International Airport, where US troops raced to complete their evacuation operation a day before their deadline. [SEP] TITLE=> Costly drone mistake bolsters doubts about Biden's Afghanistan strategy. ARTICLE=> From the first weeks of the Afghanistan war to its final days, U.S. officials repeatedly championed the use of aerial surveillance technology to distinguish friend from foe, fighter from civilian, and eliminate America’s enemies with pinpoint accuracy. The technology was heralded as a way to minimize civilian casualties and reduce the risks and costs of ground deployments. In practice, though, the U.S. military got it wrong — a lot — leading to high-profile civilian deaths and handing the Taliban a potent recruitment tool. [SEP] TITLE=> A Tale of Two Drone Strikes. ARTICLE=> When then-President Trump ordered a strike that killed two leaders of two terrorist organizations with zero collateral damage, many in the media, academia, and Hollywood immediately condemned it as impulsive and dangerous. When President Biden ordered a drone strike against alleged ISIS-K members that instead killed an aid worker and his family, the reaction in those same quarters amounted to barely a reprimand. The study in contrasts underscores just how differently the two presidents’ actions are filtered through the media and academia prisms.

TITLE=> Elect Joe Biden, America. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden has vowed to be a president for all Americans, even those who do not support him. In previous elections, such a promise might have sounded trite or treacly. Today, the idea that the president should have the entire nation’s interests at heart feels almost revolutionary. Mr. Biden has also vowed to “restore the soul of America.” It is a painful reminder that the country is weaker, angrier, less hopeful and more divided than it was four years ago. [SEP] TITLE=> The man and the record. ARTICLE=> “He’s unpresidential.” “He’s crude and unkind.” “He’s just not a good man.” These things, and much worse, are commonly said of President Donald Trump.

Therefore, the public and its leaders, who every day must view and live among their work, have no opinion that counts. Elites as judge, jury, and, ultimately, executioner. Sound familiar?

That sort of "social distancing" is considered essential to slowing the spread of the virus and easing the burden on the beleaguered health infrastructure. But for those suffering from depression, especially those who struggle with suicidal thoughts, it is definitely not what the doctor ordered. Any "isolation is so devastating to our own mood because we're left stuck with our own thoughts," said Emily Roberts, a Manhattan-based psychotherapist.

Rather than stay behind and help coordinate aid and federal assistance, the state’s junior senator went to Cancún, if only for a day, before widespread outrage brought him back to the United States.

If that date passes without the documents or a resolution to the dispute, House Democrats and the Trump administration could be headed for a clash in federal court.

TITLE=> Libertarian Candidates Pitch Themselves As Antidote To Partisanship. ARTICLE=> Libertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson and Bill Weld pitched themselves as the antidote to Washington partisanship in a CNN town hall, hoping to appeal to voters frustrated with both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees. Both are former Republican governors — Johnson from New Mexico and Weld from Massachusetts — and told CNN's Anderson Cooper they align with most voters on both fiscal and social issues. [SEP] TITLE=> Can Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Nominee, Swing the Election?. ARTICLE=> In Gary Johnson’s first run for the presidency in 2012, as the Libertarian Party candidate, he won just under 1 percent of the popular vote. He did not surpass 3 percent in any state. That’s not exactly a strong showing. But 2016 could prove more favorable because of the unpopularity of both major party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Mr. Johnson is at roughly 10 percent in recent polls, well above where he was in 2012. The question, of course, is whether it will have any impact. [SEP] TITLE=> How Gary Johnson/William Weld CNN Town Hall Was a Disappointment in Libertarian Terms. ARTICLE=> The Libertarian Party presidential ticket of former Republican governors Gary Johnson (N.M.) and William Weld (Mass.) succeeded in seeming human, humane, decent, calm, and at least compared to their major party competitors, thoughtful this evening at their second CNN Town Hall. But I'm not sure they succeeded in seeming very Libertarian, or selling the Party's position as a distinct outlook on politics and government that someone could grasp and understand.

ARTICLE=> It was the sort of short-term outlook that has been a centerpiece of President Trump’s approach to the coronavirus. The long-planned convention in Charlotte would be scaled downward, the Trump campaign announced June 11, in favor of holding a more boisterous speech from the president in the city of Jacksonville. The reason for the change was explicit: Charlotte’s mayor was mandating procedures aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus. Those procedures meant masks and physically separated convention attendees.

It’s a note Trump struck in 2016, when it looked like he almost certainly would not win, and it’s a scorched earth approach to democracy that he’s only made more extreme this time around. There’s no way to frame Trump’s approach to the upcoming vote as anything other than the stuff of strongmen and authoritarians. This is how elections are treated in Ankara and Moscow.
