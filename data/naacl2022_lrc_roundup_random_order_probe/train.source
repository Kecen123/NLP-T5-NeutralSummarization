Eight previous vetoes of legislation have been upheld.

TITLE=> The worst of the coronavirus recession is past. Now what?. ARTICLE=> When the Department of Commerce announced on Thursday that the advanced estimate for second-quarter GDP growth came in with a bone-chilling 32.9% decline on an annualized basis, Congress was debating the details of another multitrillion-dollar relief package for America’s beleaguered, coronavirus-fatigued population. An extended federal supplement for the more than 20 million unemployed people, along with perhaps another round of cash payments for families, will almost surely be finalized before Congress goes on recess. [SEP] TITLE=> We won’t ignore the horrible economic numbers. ARTICLE=> Minutes after horrible economic numbers — a 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims — were released, President Trump tweeted out a statement suggesting we should delay the election. Clearly, he wants us to ignore the 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross national product and 1.43 million new jobless claims. But we won’t ignore the 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims. Do not get me wrong. [SEP] TITLE=> GDP Plunged 32.9%: Here's Why It Matters. ARTICLE=> The Commerce Department's initial estimate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter was, in a word, historic. The value of all goods and services purchased last quarter plunged at a 32.9% annual rate. This followed a 5% contraction in the first quarter of 2020.
TITLE=> Martin Luther King’s wisdom, words and compassion are needed now more than ever. ARTICLE=> As we pause to reflect on the life and assassination of one of the greatest and most courageous leaders in history – 50 years ago on April 4, 1968 – I recall how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. became a hero to me, when I was a poor and often homeless white boy all those years ago.

TITLE=> Why you should care about the semiconductor chip crisis. ARTICLE=> Are you worried about your chip supply? Not potato chips. Not poker chips. And not wood chips. I am talking about the shortage of semiconductor chips, which you may not realize influence everything from your cell phone to your car, your game console to national security. We are talking about a nearly $500 billion semiconductor industry manufacturing silicon wafers using complex processes that allow us to do everything from drive to play. [SEP] TITLE=> The global chip shortage is going from bad to worse. Here's why you should care. ARTICLE=> In the market for a new car, smartphone or washing machine this year? A global shortage of computer chips could mean you have to wait a while and pay more. A growing number of manufacturers around the world are having trouble securing supplies of semiconductors, delaying the production and delivery of goods and threatening to push up the prices paid by consumers. Several factors are driving the crunch, which was initially concentrated in the auto industry. [SEP] TITLE=> Government Won’t Fix the Semiconductor Shortage. ARTICLE=> Jerry Sanders, a former chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association and a founder of Advanced Micro Devices , predicted in the 1970s that “semiconductors would prove to be the crude oil of the information age.” It was an understatement. Midprice automobiles today are controlled by 100 or more silicon chips. Cars couldn’t meet legal standards for mileage or pollution—or even start—without chips, let alone connect to the internet or display a fancy digital dashboard.

[SEP] TITLE=> Trump Puts Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal On Hold Until Congress Passes This Bill.

ARTICLE=> The (partial) government shutdown is over: Minutes ago, the majority of Senate Democrats voted for a three-week funding extension bill that includes a six-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, purportedly doing so in exchange for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s promise to bring DACA legislation to the floor of the chamber for debate/voting no later than Feb. 8. (A substantial number of existing DACA protections for undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children begin expiring March 5.)

[SEP] TITLE=> Manchin says $1.5 trillion is his limit on Biden economic agenda amid battle with progressives. ARTICLE=> Moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia made clear Thursday that $1.5 trillion was the price tag he was willing to settle on for his party's plan to expand the social safety net, putting him $2 trillion away from the lowest number progressive Democrats have said they would accept. Manchin said he informed President Joe Biden that was his number, and Biden said he needed more than that. "I've never been a liberal in any way, shape or form," Manchin said. "I'm willing to come from zero to 1.5 (trillion)." [SEP] TITLE=> Manchin sets $1.5 trillion limit on spending package, dealing blow to Biden agenda. ARTICLE=> Sen. Joe Manchin dealt a blow to fellow Democrats and President Joe Biden Thursday, announcing he won’t back a massive social welfare spending package that costs more than $1.5 trillion.

TITLE=> What we know about the spread of Covid among children — and whether shutting schools reduces the risk. ARTICLE=> The science around the link between children and the spread of the coronavirus is still evolving, but a growing body of evidence suggests that kids attending school do play an important role in community transmission. The issue comes as the resurgent spread of Covid-19 has prompted most of Europe to adopt the strictest level of public health measures, with many countries in the region shutting schools as part of a broader plan to curb infection rates and alleviate the strain on already stressed health facilities. [SEP] TITLE=> New Study Finds COVID Transmission in Schools Is ‘Extremely Rare’. ARTICLE=> A new peer-reviewed study from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that in-school transmission of COVID-19 is "extremely rare." In a collaborative study between Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, researchers discovered that among 11 school districts with nearly 100,000 staff and students, there were no instances of children passing the coronavirus to adults during in-person instruction. Researchers found just 32 cases of either kid-to-kid or adult-to-adult coronavirus transmission over nine weeks. [SEP] TITLE=> Is it safe to send your kids to school?. ARTICLE=> Ten months into the pandemic, the prospect of reopening K-12 schools is divisive. Yet unlike wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus — a politicized act which is scientifically proven to work — there is far more nuance between the "right" and "wrong" option for in-person schooling. And it can be wildly variable depending on the region. Recently, Chicago has found itself facing this very question of reopening schools.

TITLE=> Supreme Court gives cheerleader victory in school free speech case.

TITLE=> If the China Story Is True, Milley Has to Go. ARTICLE=> Iagree with our editorial that General Mark Milley should be aggressively investigated and, if the Washington Post reporting is verified, removed from office. In fact, I think he ought to be pressed, as a preliminary matter, about whether the reporting is substantially accurate; if he concedes that it is, he should be suspended immediately pending an investigation.

[SEP] TITLE=> Vote shows Pelosi's impeachment inquiry more partisan than Clinton effort. ARTICLE=> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is already falling behind the 1998 GOP in her impeachment push after Thursday’s vote to launch an inquiry, where she was unable to win a single Republican’s support. The 232-196 vote even saw two Democrats side with the GOP against the effort, marking a stark break with 1998, the last time Congress pursued impeachment.

It’s the first step in what promises to be a long legal battle over whether to let the ban go into effect.

The complaint was filed in the United States District Court of the Middle District of Alabama. [SEP] TITLE=> ACLU, Planned Parenthood sue over Alabama abortion ban.

ARTICLE=> WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 1.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, a historically high pace that shows that many employers are still laying people off in the face of a resurgent coronavirus.

Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, firing back in a tweet at Fox News host Tucker Carlson, after he slammed her as a “deeply silly and unimpressive person” on his show Monday. Carlson also counted Duckworth, who lost her legs while flying a U.S. Army helicopter in Iraq in 2004, among those who “actually hate America” because she supports a “national dialogue” about whether monuments should be removed and military bases renamed as the country re-examines its history. [SEP] TITLE=> Tucker Carlson Doesn’t Know What Patriotism Is. ARTICLE=> A little over 240 years ago, two of my ancestors put on the uniform of George Washington’s Continental Army and marched into battle, willing to die if it meant bringing their fledgling nation inches closer to independence. Centuries later, in 1992, I followed in their footsteps and joined the Army.

TITLE=> Even Tulsi Gabbard admits Bernie Sanders's presidential dreams are dead. ARTICLE=> After a year of barely cracking 1% support in national polls, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ended her presidential campaign. That the Hawaii congresswoman finally conceded that two delegates from American Samoa were not enough to clinch the Democratic nomination was not surprising. That she decided to issue a glowing endorsement of presumptive nominee Joe Biden in the process of her withdrawal absolutely was. As a matter of pure ideology, Gabbard's endorsement constitutes an enormous practical concession that Biden is the de facto nominee. [SEP] TITLE=> Tulsi Gabbard Drops Out And Endorses Joe Biden. ARTICLE=> Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is suspending her longshot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination and throwing her support behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the Hawaii congresswoman announced on Thursday. “I owe you an incredible debt of gratitude for all you’ve done as the heart and soul of our people-powered campaign: Today, I’ve made the decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency,” Gabbard said in a note to her campaign’s supporters.

ARTICLE=> As President Donald Trump has persistently discussed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, critics have wondered about his motivation, given the drug’s far-from-certain performance on the global stage as a treatment for coronavirus, and the Food and Drug Administration’s refusal so far to approve it as a treatment for COVID-19.

Rules are, or should be, clear bright lines that can produce yes-or-no answers. Judgments are more complicated than that. They need not be as standardless as Potter Stewart’s famous definition of pornography (“I know it when I see it”), but judgments typically involve a good deal more weighing and balancing of multiple factors, sometimes in ways that don’t reduce to a mathematical formula.
TITLE=> The Mueller Report's Biggest Open Secret. ARTICLE=> Nearly every claim made by Donald Trump and his allies in the Republican Party about Volume 1 of the Mueller Report—that copious volume that deals with accusations Trump or his campaign conspired with the Kremlin—has been false. Trump and his advocates say Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy? That's not true. They say Mueller found no evidence of coordination? Also false. Mueller found no evidence of collusion? False. Mueller considered the facts from every angle but couldn't establish any conspiracy between Trump or his campaign and Russian nationals? False. [SEP] TITLE=> Andrew McCarthy: Mueller's testimony will not give Democrats what they crave. Can they handle it?. ARTICLE=> Prepare to be disappointed. That should be Democrats' mindset heading into Robert Mueller’s appearance this week before two House committees. The greater the anticipation of the testimony, the more the letdown is apt to be. That is because the special counsel simply is not going to give them what they crave. [SEP] TITLE=> Republican lawmaker complains to Mueller about lack of Fox News in his report. ARTICLE=> Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) should send a letter to Fox News saying the following: Do more investigative journalism. Break more news. That is the most logical recourse in light of her questioning of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on Wednesday in another one of those congressional super-hearings.
TITLE=> The great Texas climate catastrophe is heading your way. ARTICLE=> The Green New Deal has come, believe it or not, to the state of Texas. How's it working out so far? Well, the good news is all that alternative energy seems to have had a remarkable effect on the climate. Sunday night, parts of Texas got the temperatures that we typically see in Alaska. In fact, they were the same as they were in Alaska. So global warming is no longer a pressing concern in Houston. The bad news is, they don't have electricity. [SEP] TITLE=> 'Massive failure': Why are millions of people in Texas still without power?. ARTICLE=> Power outages across Texas have left millions of people in the dark and bitter cold this week amid an unprecedented winter storm that buried the state in snow and ice and brought single-degree temperatures.

[SEP] TITLE=> Disasters in Republican-run places keep somehow proving how bad Democrats are at running things. ARTICLE=> To some very small extent, we should appreciate the frankness of Tim Boyd, until Tuesday the mayor of the town of Colorado City, Tex., population 4,000. Boyd, faced with massive power outages like much of the state, simply threw up his hands. “The City and County, along with power providers or any other service owes you NOTHING!” he wrote on Facebook. “I’m sick and tired of people looking for a d--- handout!
TITLE=> Why COVID-19 Vaccines Should Not Be Required for All Americans. ARTICLE=> COVID-19 vaccine mandates have become a hotly contested issue, as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations rebound nationwide, driven by the highly contagious delta variant and unswerving vaccine hesitancy. New York City will soon be the first major U.S. city to require proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, gyms and other indoor public spaces. Dr. Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and editor in chief of MedPage Today, argues that mandating vaccines for "every living, walking American" is, as of now, not well-supported by science. [SEP] TITLE=> COVID-19 Survivors Have Broad, Longer-Term Immunity. ARTICLE=> People who have recovered from COVID-19 retain broad and effective longer-term immunity to the disease, according to a new study. Findings of the study, which is the most comprehensive of its kind so far, have implications for expanding understanding about human immune memory as well as future vaccine development for coronaviruses. [SEP] TITLE=> Natural infection isn't enough to protect against COVID-19, experts say. You still need a vaccine.. ARTICLE=> As concerned friends and family members try to convince loved ones to get vaccinated, many are met with the argument: "I already got COVID, so I can't get it again." Health experts say that just isn't true. Although antibodies from natural infection may provide some protection against the virus, evidence shows nothing protects against COVID-19 better than vaccines. People who have recovered from COVID-19 should get vaccinated to reduce their risk of reinfection, which will prevent transmission and suppress the opportunity for more variants – like the highly contagious delta – to emerge.

TITLE=> America's Russia nightmare is back. ARTICLE=> Washington (CNN) - It's happening again. America is blundering into a new Russia election-meddling hall of mirrors that's already doing Moscow's work: tearing fresh political divides and threatening to again tarnish democracy's most sacred moment, a national election. Revelations Thursday about intelligence assessments that Russia has launched a new interference effort to help reelect Donald Trump -- and the President's furious reaction -- mark the return of a recurring nightmare for the country just nine months before the presidential election. [SEP] TITLE=> Intel officials say Russia boosting Trump candidacy. ARTICLE=> WASHINGTON (AP) — Intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign to help President Donald Trump get reelected, according to three officials familiar with the closed-door briefing. Trump pushed back Friday accusing Democrats of launching a disinformation campaign. “Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!” Trump tweeted. [SEP] TITLE=> Why the Trump-Russia intelligence report doesn't quite add up. ARTICLE=> The New York Times reported on Thursday that "intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected." I'm not convinced that gives full context to the briefing. I suspect a Democratic member asked a briefer something along the lines of, "Do you assess that Russia is trying to reelect Trump?" The briefer then probably offered a hedged response in the affirmative.
TITLE=> Biden’s Obamacare Do-Over: Another Chance to Sign Up, This One More Publicized. ARTICLE=> In December, the last Obamacare enrollment period under the Trump administration closed. Now that the Biden administration has arrived, it’s trying a do-over.

TITLE=> Derek Chauvin trial and George Floyd's death: Live updates. ARTICLE=> Former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin's trial began Monday morning. Chauvin faces three charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, a white 19-year veteran of the department, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes. The nearly nine-minute video of Floyd's death, in which he can repeatedly be heard saying, "I can't breathe," led to global protests last year against police brutality.

ARTICLE=> The video of George Floyd gasping for breath was front and center Monday as the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee on the Black man’s neck went on trial Monday on charges of murder and manslaughter.

[SEP] TITLE=> Derek Chauvin’s Attorney Opens Trial Claiming He Used ‘Necessary’ Force during George Floyd Arrest. ARTICLE=> Attorneys representing former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin opened his murder trial Monday morning by arguing that their client used a “necessary” level of force while arresting George Floyd, and said that Floyd’s death was the result of a combination of factors outside Chauvin’s control.

Floyd lost consciousness while Chauvin knelt on his neck, and was pronounced dead soon after the incident.
TITLE=> Celebrations for Biden, Harris probably spread coronavirus, Bay Area health experts warn. ARTICLE=> The impromptu celebrations for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris after the marathon presidential election could very well have harmed the new president’s goal of taming the coronavirus pandemic, Bay Area epidemiologists said. Corks popped in the Bay Area and across the nation after the two ended President Trump’s four-year reign, but it was pretty clear from television crowd shots that social distancing was not foremost on the minds of the shouting, chanting, singing revelers, some of whom even snuck in hugs and kisses. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden silent on lack of social distancing, possible 'super spreader' celebrations. ARTICLE=> Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has not addressed concerns that some celebrations of his projected victory may contribute to the spread of coronavirus after his transition team declared Biden will always "listen to science."

That is the lowest weekly figure since March 2020, but still way above the levels of around 220,000 that prevailed early last year, before the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. economy. “The labor market is on a recovery path,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the job site Indeed.

Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting 700,000 filings. Continuing claims for the week ended April 3, meanwhile, ticked up to 3.731 million from 3.727 million the prior week. That number was above the 3.7 million that was expected.

[SEP] TITLE=> The Republican Party Is Attacking Democracy. ARTICLE=> It turns out there was a coordinated attack on the 2020 election after all. It began several years ago and accelerated in the last several months. Now that Election Day has passed, it has launched into overdrive. Its weapons are baseless insinuation and evidence-free charges, deployed solely to sow chaos and undermine the results of a free and fair election — one that produced a clear winner and an even clearer loser. But the most dangerous attackers of American democracy aren’t the Russians or the Chinese.
TITLE=> 'A distinctly American phenomenon': Our workforce is dying faster than any other wealthy country, study shows. ARTICLE=> The engine that powers the world’s most potent economy is dying at a worrisome pace, a “distinctly American phenomenon’’ with no easily discernible cause or simple solution. Those are some of the conclusions from a comprehensive new study by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University showing that mortality rates for U.S. adults ages 25-64 continue to increase, driving down the general population’s life expectancy for at least three consecutive years. [SEP] TITLE=> Death Rate of Middle-Aged Americans Rises for Third Year. ARTICLE=> In 2010, U.S. life expectancy stopped rising. In 2014, it actually began to decline.

Last month, Mexico made a deal with the United States to crack down on Central American migrants who are trying to make their way to the U.S. border.

TITLE=> Hydroxychloroquine: Evidence suggests it is relatively safe. ARTICLE=> Is hydroxychloroquine a generally safe drug? The politically charged atmosphere surrounding the drug in the context of COVID-19 can present a distorted picture. But the best evidence suggests that it has few adverse effects, although it does present some risks for patients with heart conditions. Dr. Alieta Eck, who prescribed hydroxychloroquine for her patients who had COVID-19 symptoms, was confident the drug was safe. "My feeling was that it was not going to do any harm, which is true. [SEP] TITLE=> Hydroxychloroquine being 'discarded prematurely', say scientists. ARTICLE=> A trial investigating the drug hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment against Covid-19 may never find out if it's effective, say scientists involved. Controversy around the drug - touted by President Trump and the subject of online misinformation - is stopping completion of the trial, they say. It is ineffective in hospitalised patients, but investigators hope it might work if given earlier on. Hospitals have pulled out of the trial. The Oxford University-led trial is aiming to enrol 40,000 frontline workers around the world. [SEP] TITLE=> Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prevention? How to separate science from partisanship. ARTICLE=> A Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 American adults conducted in April found that 53 percent of Republicans were willing to take anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, while only 18 percent of Democrats were willing to try it. The utter arbitrariness of how public opinion on scientific questions has fractured along partisan divides reveals something rotten at the core of the national conversation. No one is surprised to see political polarization around issues of taxation, immigration, welfare or military spending.

TITLE=> Labor Shortages Give Low-Pay Workers a Raise. Inflation Eats It Up.. ARTICLE=> This should be the best of times for low-wage workers, as pandemic-induced labor shortages force employers to sharply raise pay.

This is a slower pace of consumer price hikes than the 0.5 percent rate in July and the 0.9 percent in June, with the latter marking the highest monthly spike in the measure since 2008.

TITLE=> Critical race theory: Who gets to decide what is history?. ARTICLE=> A tug of war over the teaching of American history and race is playing out in state legislatures. Given the chasm between views on either side, what is the best path forward? Kenya Minott and Robin Steenman are both concerned about the national uproar around critical race theory, but for different reasons. For Dr. Minott, a consultant in Houston who provides anti-racism training, the recent bill passed by Texas lawmakers is a frightening effort to discourage conversations about systemic racism that could lead to better racial justice. [SEP] TITLE=> What the hysteria over critical race theory is really all about. ARTICLE=> Watching the news or browsing social media, it would be easy to think that critical race theory is a complicated, controversial, or new idea. But critical race theory, created four decades ago by legal scholars, is an academic framework for examining how racism is embedded in America’s laws and institutions. It is just now receiving widespread attention because it has morphed into a catchall category, one used by Republicans who want to ban anti-racist teachings and trainings in classrooms and workplaces across the country. [SEP] TITLE=> CRT Backlash Is Not Astroturf. ARTICLE=> Texas has joined Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Tennessee in passing laws to ban public schools from teaching critical race theory (CRT). Other states, such as Florida, have done so through executive rulemaking. This is a positive first step towards reclaiming American education from openly anti-American pedagogy. The intellectual roots of CRT can be found in Marxist-influenced critical theory, which began in the academia of Weimar Germany. It developed into an “intersectional” ideology at Harvard Law School in the late 1980s, through Kimberlé Crenshaw and other supporters of Professor Derrick Bell.

Remember when Virginia’s Democratic lieutenant governor hired Brett Kavanaugh’s lawyers to defend him from allegations of sexual assault? Remember when his accuser hired Christine Blasey Ford’s attorneys?

ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump claims that he’s taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against contracting coronavirus, and that he has taken zinc and antibiotic azithromycin as well.

Few people I’ve read argue that it’s a useful prophylactic. [SEP] TITLE=> It's not so crazy for Trump to take hydroxychloroquine. ARTICLE=> After weeks of going quiet on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the anti-malarial drug he used to tout as a "game-changer" for the coronavirus, President Trump startled everyone yesterday by announcing that he was taking it himself.

[SEP] TITLE=> What we learned from Trump’s hydroxychloroquine claim. ARTICLE=> The Food and Drug Administration has already warned: “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.” In its public warning (necessitated in part by President Trump’s hyping of a dangerous drug) the FDA explained, “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia.

The Taliban now insist they have changed, but will still rule Afghanistan within the norms of Islamic law.
TITLE=> Big Government Is Back, And 3 Other Takeaways From Biden's Address To Congress. ARTICLE=> President Biden's joint address to Congress looked back over the challenges he faced taking office 100 days ago in the midst of a pandemic — and declared "America is on the move again." But the speech also outlined an ambitious, active role for the government to continue helping Americans struggling, as well as new proposals to boost the country's ability to compete. It amounted to an updated New Deal, but one that faces a precarious path to get through razor-thin margins in both the House and Senate. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden Just Gave the Most Ideologically Ambitious Speech of Any Democratic President in Generations. ARTICLE=> With his vow to spend money on blue-collar jobs and tax the rich, Biden’s program aims to splinter the Trump Coalition. President Joe Biden’s address to a joint session Congress was the most ambitious ideological statement made by any Democratic president in decades—couched in language that made it sound as if he wasn’t making an ideological argument at all. Make no mistake that he was. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden’s Dishonest Sales Pitch. ARTICLE=> President Biden’s address to Congress connected only intermittently with reality. On his telling, every good thing that has happened in America since he took office — from vaccination to job creation — is a tribute to his wisdom, rather than a continuation of a trajectory set beforehand. All presidents say such stuff, and they all get away with it, although Senator Tim Scott made a valiant attempt to correct the record. Worse was the dishonesty of Biden’s sales pitch for his policies.

TITLE=> Fauci: You Have the Private Sector To Thank For Wuhan Coronavirus Tests, Not the Gov't 'System'. ARTICLE=> The government “system” could not hold a candle to the private sector on coronavirus testing, Dr. Anthony Fauci explained Thursday during an Instagram story interview with NBA star Steph Curry, which is why the U.S. has seen a drastic uptick in accurate and widespread test kits available. “We have hundreds of thousands of tests that are out there now, mostly because we got the private sector involved, of the companies who know how to make it well, make large amounts,” Fauci told the Golden State Warriors player. [SEP] TITLE=> Despite Trump’s claims, the U.S. is far behind in coronavirus testing. ARTICLE=> President Trump gave the United States a pat on the back on this week, saying the nation had done more coronavirus testing than South Korea, a country widely seen as a model in its management of the pandemic. But his comparison was misleading. “Just reported that the United States has done far more ‘testing’ than any other nation, by far!” Trump said in a tweet Wednesday morning. [SEP] TITLE=> The coronavirus test that wasn’t: How federal health officials misled state scientists and derailed the best chance at containment. ARTICLE=> The coronavirus epidemic this week reached Beadle County, South Dakota. A single case tied to travel has exploded into 14 infections and counting, with no way to know how many were exposed while supply shortages forced the entire state to briefly suspend testing.

TITLE=> Downstate judge rules Pritzker out of line with stay-at-home – but governor calls suit ‘dangerous,’ ‘insult to all Illinoisans’. ARTICLE=> A downstate judge on Monday agreed with a Republican legislator that Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker lacks the legal authority to force him to stay home past 30 days during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s a decision that only applies to the Southern Illinois lawmaker – state Rep. Darren Bailey – but the governor said it will endanger all Illinoisans and open the door for others to file suit. Pritzker was made aware of Clay County Circuit Court Judge Michael McHaney’s ruling Monday afternoon during his live COVID-19 briefing “Rep. [SEP] TITLE=> Illinois judge rules against Gov. Pritzker's stay-at-home order in suit brought by GOP lawmaker. ARTICLE=> An Illinois court has ruled against Gov. J.B.

[SEP] TITLE=> Pritzker appeals judge’s ruling against Illinois stay-at-home order. ARTICLE=> CHICAGO — Illinois. Gov. JB Pritzker filed an appeal Tuesday after a state lawmaker challenged his coronavirus stay-at-home order and won. The appeal calls for a reversal of that ruling, and to dissolve Republican Rep. Darren Bailey’s temporary restraining order. On Monday, Clay County Circuit Judge Michael McHaney issued a temporary injunction so Bailey could disregard the stay-at-home order. Bailey, a Xenia resident, argued Pritzker did not have the authority to extend his stay-at-home order beyond the initial 30 days.
TITLE=> Free Market for Education? Economists Generally Don’t Buy It. ARTICLE=> The odds are good that privatizing education will be part of the agenda for President-elect Donald J. Trump’s administration. The Republican platform calls for increasing the role of banks in giving out student loans. And Mr. Trump and the platform advocate an expansion of both vouchers, which enable students to attend the private school of their choice with government funds, and charter schools. [SEP] TITLE=> IGM Forum: Education. ARTICLE=> (Survey among economic experts) Public school students would receive a higher quality education if they all had the option of taking the government money (local, state, federal) currently being spent on their own education and turning that money into vouchers that they could use towards covering the costs of any private school or public school of their choice (e.g. charter schools). [SEP] TITLE=> The New York Times Gets Everything Wrong in This Article That Falsely Claims Economists Don’t Like School Choice.

Amazingly, the author of the piece misrepresents the very data she is using to build her erroneous case against school choice.
TITLE=> Anger Is Justified, Riots Never Are. ARTICLE=> Sometimes a responsibility falls to you that you never anticipated. Sometimes history just demands that someone should say it: Riots are bad. Riots are never a coherent or moral response to injustice, they just multiply injustices and the rioters themselves often suffer more in the long run. [SEP] TITLE=> Want to stop these riots? Reform the police.. ARTICLE=> Every Fourth of July when I was a boy, the Jaycees sponsored a carnival at our local park, followed by a concert from the town’s volunteer band and a fireworks show. The water-balloon toss and the cotton candy machine were delightful, I suppose, but the attraction that galvanized every boy at the fair was the chance to lay down two bucks for the chance to swing a sledgehammer at an old car. This was big money in those days. [SEP] TITLE=> Demonstrations rage across the country.

TITLE=> Trump says gun policy with 82 percent support has 'not much political support (to put it mildly).'. ARTICLE=> Donald Trump is trying to defend his "school safety" plan, which doesn’t call for an age limit on assault weapon purchases (but does support arming teachers). Predictably, his claims about those age limits are all about deflecting and obfuscating (or, to be less polite, are full of crap).

TITLE=> Trump Is Suspending Certain Visas For Foreign Workers. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration on Monday announced it will be suspending some employment-based visas for foreigners to protect American workers as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic — a move derided by companies who say they need access to skilled labor that they can’t get in the United States. The suspension, which will stay in place through the end of the year, will not immediately impact workers already in the US. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump To Suspend Visas Through End Of The Year — DHS Guidance Outlines Specific Exceptions To The Order.

[SEP] TITLE=> Biden’s ‘transformative vision,’ Democrats’ plans unfazed by meltdown in Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> The chaos in Afghanistan may have changed global headlines, but it has done little to shake Democrats from their course at home. House members return to Capitol Hill on Monday to begin advancing the party’s $3.5 trillion makeover of the American social safety net. Debates about welcoming tens of thousands of Afghan migrants did nothing to derail Democrats’ hopes of approving an amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants already in the U.S. as part of that makeover. [SEP] TITLE=> U.S. House Democrats face test of unity on Biden spending plans. ARTICLE=> Democrats face a test of unity in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday as they begin work on two ambitious spending plans that would devote trillions of dollars to transportation infrastructure and social programs. While centrist Democrats are eager to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already won approval in the Senate, liberals say they must prioritize a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that would expand spending on childcare and education. Both measures are priorities for Democratic President Joe Biden.

TITLE=> Job openings in the US soar to record 9.3 million. ARTICLE=> America is hiring like never before. Job openings in the United States soared by nearly a million in April, setting a record for the most openings added in a month and the highest overall number since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking the data in December 2000. At 9.3 million new positions, it was far more than the 8.3 million economists polled by Refinitiv had predicted — which would have been flat from the revised March job opening numbers. [SEP] TITLE=> Is Unemployment Bonus Keeping Workers on Sideline?. ARTICLE=> Despite a stubbornly high unemployment rate of 6.1% in April — representing 9.8 million people who say they are actively looking for work — many employers are reporting that they can’t find people to hire. Republicans say the $300 a week supplement to unemployment insurance, which for many Americans amounts to a pay raise, is so generous that it is acting as a disincentive for people to return to work. [SEP] TITLE=> Job openings soar to record high 9.3 million, raising fears of labor shortage. ARTICLE=> Job openings soared to a record high at the end of April, the labor Labor Department said Tuesday, adding to fears about unfulfilled demand for workers.

TITLE=> Elon Musk plans to create a website for public to rate the press. ARTICLE=> The serial entrepreneur's new project will let the public rate "the core truth" of news articles. Elon Musk is apparently tired of "fake news" or perhaps bad press, so he's creating a new site called Pravda to let the public rate "the core truth" of articles and track credibility scores of journalists, editors and publications. The interestingly named Pravda, which was also the name of a Russian communist propaganda broadsheet, means "truth" in Russian, and it will be somewhat akin to a Yelp for journalism.

TITLE=> Coronavirus deaths lag behind surging infections but may catch up soon. ARTICLE=> With novel coronavirus infections setting a single-day national record Wednesday, health experts are taking little solace from one of the few bright spots in the current resurgence: Deaths are not rising in lockstep with caseloads. But that may be just a matter of time. “Deaths always lag considerably behind cases,” Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease specialist, told Congress at a hearing Tuesday. In the weeks to come, he and others said, the death toll is likely to rise commensurately. [SEP] TITLE=> US sets daily record of new coronavirus cases.

An Instagram page for the website WokeHub.com claimed, for example, that “donations made to Black Lives Matter website go directly to the DNC” and that BlackLivesMatter.com “appears to be an international money laundering program used by the Democratic National Committee.” A similar claim appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.com.

ARTICLE=> Most years, when our calendrical odometers turn over from a string of nines to zeroes, we take stock of the year behind us with some mix of satisfaction and regret, and set goals, make resolutions, and lay out plans for the year to come. On public questions plainly beyond our control — politics, the economy — we turn to pundits and other professional prognosticators to help us out, to better prepare for and take advantage of what the future will likely bring. [SEP] TITLE=> Yes, Most Predictions Are Wrong. They’re Also Inevitable. ARTICLE=> Politico has fun recalling the many bad predictions from politicians and television pundits throughout the course of 2020. It’s worth noting that a few predictions Politico selected aren’t quite as off-base as the others. The impeachment of President Trump did not cost Democrats the House, as Jeanine Pirro predicted, but Democrats lost seats and the impeachment certainly didn’t help Nancy Pelosi’s majority.

TITLE=> OPINION: The Second Circuit Court of Appeals Was Wrong to Rule That Trump Can’t Block Twitter Users. ARTICLE=> Earlier today the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users from following his @realDonaldTrump account. It’s an interesting decision from an ideologically diverse judicial panel that at first glance appears to be a straightforward application of conventional First Amendment law. It’s also wrong. It makes a crucial error that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of speech on private social-media platforms. Boiled down to its essence, the court’s reasoning contained two key elements. [SEP] TITLE=> U.S. Appeals Court Rules Trump Violated First Amendment By Blocking Twitter Followers. ARTICLE=> A federal appeals court in Manhattan says President Trump cannot block critics from his Twitter account, calling it "unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination." In a 29-page ruling on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's decision that found that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked certain Twitter users, because he uses his Twitter account "to conduct official business and to interact with the public." [SEP] TITLE=> A court rules (unpersuasively) that Trump can't block critics on Twitter. ARTICLE=> A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that President Trump violated the 1st Amendment by blocking some critics from access to his Twitter feed. The decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals might seem like poetic justice visited on a president who can dish it out but can’t take it. But as a matter of constitutional law, the ruling isn’t persuasive.

ARTICLE=> More than half a century after an assassin's bullet silenced him, and 35 years after the nation began observing a federal holiday in his honor, Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and legacy still resonate. As the preeminent voice of the civil rights movement, King's eloquence and vision for a united America made him an icon. His powerful words – delivered through sermons, speeches and books – symbolize a utopia to which our nation always aspires. Few people in history have been quoted more than King. [SEP] TITLE=> Has America finally heard Martin Luther King Jr.?. ARTICLE=> WHEN PRESIDENT Ronald Reagan signed the bill creating a federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., he warned that “traces of bigotry still mar” the country. This may seem the understatement of the 20th century; it would be an understatement today. [SEP] TITLE=> Continuing the African American tradition of civil society. ARTICLE=> Community uplift without government support has deep roots among African Americans. This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, it’s time to rediscover them. Each year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day encourages an upsurge in volunteer work and charitable giving. Unfortunately, it tends to be just a one-day commitment. The annual one day of celebration each year of civic-mindedness isn’t enough to keep African American communities like mine thriving, especially when so many are struggling economically in the wake of the pandemic.

[SEP] TITLE=> Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’. ARTICLE=> When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that “the helicopter couldn’t fly” and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.

The body released its sixth assessment on Monday. As with those before it, the latest appraisal was both alarming and unsurprising. Humans are warming the planet. This warming threatens civilization.

Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered emotional finales to the day’s impeachment testimony that received high praise from Democrats and even from some of President Trump’s closest GOP allies. But when Trump’s legal defense team took over Saturday morning, Schiff went from lauded orator to the top target of the effort to undercut the House managers’ case against the president.

TITLE=> Joe Biden’s vision for the economy unifies Obama’s vision with Trump’s. ARTICLE=> Newly elected president Joe Biden’s inaugural address couldn’t have been clearer about his highest priority: to restore unity. It is both a lofty and necessary goal. Unity is Biden’s only path to swiftly address the country’s spiraling health and economic crises in the wake of a president who derived his legitimacy from sowing division and distrust. “We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. [SEP] TITLE=> Fake GOP rage over Biden’s ‘unity’ speech is a sucker’s game. ARTICLE=> President Biden declared in his inaugural address that our prospects for much-needed “unity” are threatened by various political forces. Among them, he said, are racism, nativism, political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism. Republicans promptly decided that in condemning those things, Biden was actually talking about them. Republican officials and their media allies are now widely condemning these words as an attack on themselves and their voters. The obvious trick is to game the media into saying Biden is already reneging on his unity promise by being divisive. [SEP] TITLE=> Against Unity. ARTICLE=> Joe Biden, giving an inaugural address so forgettable that he himself seemed to have forgotten much of it, emphasized the need for “unity.” He is not the first with the unity talk. Barack Obama talked up unity in his 2009 inaugural, insisting that Americans must choose “unity of purpose over conflict and discord.” Donald Trump was not famous for his enthusiasm for unity, but he nodded to it: “We are one nation,” etc.

ARTICLE=> Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) defended her support for cost-of-living increases for members of Congress on Tuesday, saying her position will help keep dark money out of politics. She said voting against a cost-of-living increase can "sound nice" but doing so makes campaign finance reform harder. She added it serves to "punish members who rely on a straight salary, and reward those who rely on money loopholes and other forms of self-dealing." "It’s not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important," she tweeted.

Eventually they threw caution to the wind and started opening on Thursday afternoons, well before most people had gotten a chance to eat dinner at all.

TITLE=> With Latest Nativist Rhetoric, Trump Takes America Back To Where It Came From. ARTICLE=> With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color, President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life. He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics — the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants. Although three of the four women were born in the United States, the president said they should all "go back" where they came from. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump’s Tweets Prove That He Is a Raging Racist. ARTICLE=> Donald Trump keeps trying to convince any disbelieving holdouts that he is a raging racist. At least, that’s how I imagine his motives.

[SEP] TITLE=> The AP’s guidelines telling journalists to decide what’s ‘racist’ are already leading to disaster. ARTICLE=> Earlier this year, the Associated Press announced a guideline change encouraging news reporters to call out racism. This might sound reasonable enough, but several media outlets just proved it’s the start of a troubling trend in journalism. “Do not use racially charged or similar terms as euphemisms for racist or racism when the latter terms are truly applicable,” the Associated Press announced in a series of tweets. “If racist is not the appropriate term, give careful thought to how best to describe the situation.

TITLE=> At The Republican National Convention, All Eyes Will Be On Trump’s Economic Record. ARTICLE=> As the Republican Convention opens I expect President Trump will make the case he is best positioned to end the recession. According to Yale professor Ray Fair’s predictive voting model, the incumbent party usually wins if the economy does better in the year of the election. Unfortunately for the Republican party, Trump may have sunk his reelection because he ignored advice from professional economists. Trump ignored economists who advised him that corporate tax cuts would not be enough to induce investment or induce firms to raise pay. [SEP] TITLE=> The GOP convention will be no summer of love. ARTICLE=> The Republican Party’s task this week will be to turn Joe Biden into something he’s not and transform President Trump’s failures into successes. If a political consultants’ Olympics gave marks for degrees of difficulty, this event would set a record. No wonder several Republican senators are taking a pass on the whole thing. But Democrats are nonetheless wary about what will come their way. The 2016 Trump Convention was a crude production, lacking in star power and uplift. A lot of big-time Republicans also stayed away. [SEP] TITLE=> Republican convention will put this uplifting story front and center. ARTICLE=> If there is one thing that Hollywood elites and the privileged politicians in the Democrat Party have both mastered, it is the art of the fictional narrative. What we saw last week at the Democratic National Convention was just that – a four-day flashy spectacle with no real substance and an entirely unrealistic portrayal of real America. It felt less like a political convention and more like a Hollywood awards show: out-of-touch, boring and filled with actors heaping praise on one another. Cue the cutoff music.

TITLE=> With More Vaccines Secured, Biden Warns of Hurdles to Come. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration said Thursday it had secured 200 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines, enough to inoculate every American adult, but President Biden warned that logistical hurdles would most likely mean that many Americans will still not have been vaccinated by the end of the summer.

TITLE=> EXPLAINER: What was the outcome of the latest Gaza war?. ARTICLE=> The cease-fire that took effect Friday appears to have halted 11 days of fighting between Israel and Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers, without resolving any of the underlying issues in the decades-old Middle East conflict.

[SEP] TITLE=> A Cease-Fire, and New Ideas in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. ARTICLE=> The cease-fire between Hamas militants in Gaza and Israel didn’t come a second too soon. Israelis should not have to live in fear of rockets raining down, which killed a dozen people living in Israel since fighting broke out 11 days ago. Nor should people in Gaza live in fear that they might become collateral damage from Israeli bombs. Israeli airstrikes and artillery killed at least 230 Palestinians, including militants and many civilians. [SEP] TITLE=> After the Israeli Cease-Fire. ARTICLE=> As we went to press, it looked like Israel and Hamas would put down their arms—for now. The truce comes less than two weeks after the terrorist group commenced its 4,000-rocket barrage on Israeli civilians—the most intense since it took over the Gaza strip in 2007. Israel’s leadership wouldn’t have approved a cease-fire if it hadn’t accomplished most of what it wanted through air strikes, but the question now is what lessons the region’s players take from the short war and the world’s response.

ARTICLE=> America's sprawling elections infrastructure has been called "a hairball" — but as people in Silicon Valley might ask, is that a feature or a bug? Then-FBI Director James Comey touted it as a good thing — "the beauty of our system," he told Congress, is that the "hairball" is too vast, unconnected and woolly to be hacked from the outside.

While he wants to be known as a strong supporter of "gun safety," his claim to fame is wanting to nuke gun owners.

TITLE=> Scientists Are Slamming The Great Barrington Declaration’s Call For “Herd Immunity”. ARTICLE=> As the Trump administration signals a willingness to build “herd immunity” by purposely allowing the coronavirus to spread, major scientific organizations are denouncing a plan they say would be life-threatening and practically impossible. That plan, laid out by three scientists in a controversial document called the "Great Barrington Declaration," calls for only protecting “vulnerable” people and letting everyone else get infected with COVID-19. The authors discussed the strategy in a meeting with two top White House officials last week. [SEP] TITLE=> White House officials promote herd immunity declaration signed by fake names: report.

TITLE=> Senate parliamentarian nixes minimum wage boost in aid package. ARTICLE=> Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has told senators that the federal minimum wage increase President Joe Biden and Democrats have been seeking would violate the chamber's rules for inclusion in a filibuster-proof pandemic relief reconciliation bill. Two sources familiar with the discussions confirmed the ruling, which emerged after arguments from aides to both parties in closed-door meetings with MacDonough this week. The decision dealt a blow to Democratic hopes of tacking the long-sought rise in the minimum wage onto the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that's taking shape. [SEP] TITLE=> Senate blocked from adding $15 minimum wage provision to COVID aid package.

Economists expect to see 165,000 jobs were added in June, after a stunningly low 75,000 payrolls added in May, according to Dow Jones.

TITLE=> It's Not Nice to Lie to the Supreme Court.

TITLE=> US sees unprecedented multiracial growth, decline in the white population for first time in history. ARTICLE=> The United States experienced unprecedented multiracial population growth and a decline in the white population for the first time in the nation’s history, according to U.S. Census officials, who released data Thursday revealing the most sweeping picture of America’s racial and ethnic makeup in a decade. “These changes reveal that the US population is much more multiracial, and more racially and ethnically diverse, than what we measured in the past,” said Nicholas Jones, the director of race, ethnicity, research and outreach for the Census Bureau's population division.

ARTICLE=> "U.S. population is much more multiracial and more diverse than what we measured in the past," said Nicholas Jones, the Census Bureau's director of race and ethnicity research, in a press release today. According to last year's census data, whites remain the country's largest racial or ethnic group. About 204.3 million people described themselves as white without also identifying with another group. (Another 31.1 million Americans identified both as white and with another group.) Still, the population identifying as white alone decreased by 8.6 percent since the previous census in 2010. [SEP] TITLE=> Native American population jumps to largest size in modern history. ARTICLE=> The number of people who identify as Native American or Alaska Native alone grew by 27.1% to 3.7 million people over the last decade, according to the U.S. Census.

There weren't any groundbreaking or game-changing moments, but here are five things that stood out: 1.

[SEP] TITLE=> A Dull Debate Night Helps the Front-Runners. ARTICLE=> The United States has never before witnessed a presidential primary debate during an ongoing impeachment process, and while Bernie Sanders insisted that all Democrats can “walk and chew gum at the same time,” tonight’s debate — perhaps overshadowed by the impeachment hearings — was an oddly flat showcase for the candidates, where almost every candidate seemed content to tread water and play it safe. MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow seemed really eager to get the candidates talking about impeachment, which was not in the interest of the candidates. [SEP] TITLE=> Commentators: Who won the Democratic debate. ARTICLE=> Democratic candidates for president took part in their party's fifth debate on Wednesday night in Atlanta and CNN commentators weighed in. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors.

TITLE=> Unprecedented Texas abortion ban goes into effect. ARTICLE=> A law that bans abortions after six weeks, including in cases of rape and incest, went into effect in Texas on Wednesday. Why it matters: The law, one the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., prohibits the practice after a fetal heartbeat is detected — before many people know they are pregnant. It also incentivizes individuals to sue anyone suspected of helping a woman obtain an abortion — and awards at least $10,000 to people who do so successfully. [SEP] TITLE=> Texas Ban on Most Abortions Takes Effect After Supreme Court Doesn’t Intervene. ARTICLE=> A Texas law that bans most abortions took effect on Sept. 1 after the Supreme Court did not respond to an emergency motion that asked it to block the law. Senate Bill 8 bars doctors from performing abortions unless he or she has tried detecting a fetal heartbeat. Only if a heartbeat is not detected can the doctor perform an abortion, unless a medical emergency exists. The legislation explicitly forbids state officials from enforcing it. [SEP] TITLE=> Texas 6-week abortion ban takes effect after Supreme Court inaction. ARTICLE=> A controversial Texas law that bars abortions at six weeks went into effect early Wednesday morning after the Supreme Court and a federal appeals court failed to rule on pending emergency requests brought by abortion providers. The lack of judicial intervention means that the law -- which is one of the strictest in the nation and bans abortion before many people know they are pregnant -- goes into force absent further court intervention.

TITLE=> The ways Joe Biden or Donald Trump would get 270 electoral votes and the White House. ARTICLE=> As states worked to tally remaining ballots two days after Election Day, Democratic nominee Joe Biden sat just shy Thursday of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. Votes counted in undecided states so far show the paths both he and President Donald Trump have to the 270 electoral vote threshold that would earn them the presidency. As of Thursday morning Biden had won 253 electoral votes, according to NBC News projections. Trump trailed with 214. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump’s Path, Updated. ARTICLE=> It has to go through Pennsylvania, which is necessary but not sufficient. He needs to take Pennsylvania, hold onto Georgia and North Carolina, then take either Arizona (for 279 electoral votes) or Nevada (for 274). Biden leads in both of those states. But Trump is gaining in Arizona, and it’s entirely conceivable that he could overtake Biden there (despite Fox and AP prematurely calling it for Biden). The problem is Pennsylvania, where Trump has been losing ground fast, and Georgia, where he is hanging on by a thread. [SEP] TITLE=> Does Biden Need Pennsylvania to Win? The Alternative Election Path to 270.

In their wisdom, the founders placed the bar at an appropriately high two-thirds. Nonetheless, impeachment will be in the first paragraph of Trump's obituary.

TITLE=> Afghanistan: What Biden's critics get wrong, and the debt owed Afghan refugees. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration could certainly have better planned the extraction of civilians from Afghanistan. Yet media and politicians portray the fall of Afghanistan as a broader strategic debacle for U.S. foreign policy and President Joe Biden. They say America’s abandonment of the elected government in Kabul undermines U.S. efforts to support democracy elsewhere; harms U.S. alliance commitments; will be a boon for terrorists, and is likely to result in massive human rights violations. These criticisms exaggerate the fallout. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden’s Deadly Afghanistan Gamble. ARTICLE=> It is almost surely the case that President Joe Biden’s Afghan withdrawal was propelled by political considerations rather than any pressing moral or foreign-policy imperative. Biden, who for 20 years has taken whatever the most popular position happened to be on Afghanistan (so, all of them), believed he could get a quick, much-needed political victory. [SEP] TITLE=> Let’s Not Pretend That the Way We Withdrew From Afghanistan Was the Problem. ARTICLE=> In 2005, my colleagues at The American Prospect, Sam Rosenfeld and Matt Yglesias, wrote an essay I think about often. It was called “The Incompetence Dodge,” and it argued that American policymakers and pundits routinely try to rescue the reputation of bad ideas by attributing their failure to poor execution. At the time, they were writing about the liberal hawks who were blaming the catastrophe of the Iraq war on the Bush administration’s maladministration rather than rethinking the enterprise in its totality.

The movement has no unified structure or national leadership. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump, Lacking Clear Authority, Says U.S. Will Declare Antifa a Terrorist Group. ARTICLE=> President Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that the United States would designate a group of far-left anti-fascism activists as a terrorist organization, a declaration that lacked any clear legal authority, as his administration sought to blame the group for violent protests across the nation over the weekend. “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Mr. Trump wrote. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump Says Antifa to Be Designated a Terrorist Organization.

ARTICLE=> Democrats are launching their investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection Tuesday with a focus on the law enforcement officers who were attacked and beaten as the rioters broke into the building — an effort to put a human face on the violence of the day.

ARTICLE=> Four police officers who worked to defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters are due to testify on Tuesday at the first hearing before a congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 riot.

TITLE=> How President Donald Trump failed to connect with voters at ABC News town hall. ARTICLE=> As the 2020 Tour de France comes to its final stages, I thought I would use some cycling metaphors to assess the town hall meeting ABC News held with President Donald Trump, seven weeks ahead of Election Day. The Tour is one of the most grueling and difficult sporting events in the world, and is often described as a "team sport with an individual winner." the same is true of presidential campaigns.

[SEP] TITLE=> Trump supporters protest outside Arizona voting center during vote-counting. ARTICLE=> Supporters of President Trump protested outside an Arizona election center late Wednesday, chanting "count the votes!" as elections officials continued to tabulate ballots in a state that Joe Biden is projected to win.

[SEP] TITLE=> Portland election unrest reroutes emergency services as destructive crowds block street access. ARTICLE=> Emergency services in Portland had to be rerouted and were even temporarily blocked by crowds overnight, as hundreds of demonstrators left a trail of damage downtown following Election Day.

[SEP] TITLE=> William Barr Speaks Truth to (Illegitimate) Power. ARTICLE=> When E. F. Hutton speaks, people listen. When William Barr speaks, call an electrician. Mental circuits trip and temperament fuses blow. The attorney general, bucking the behavior of attorneys generally, displays all the emotion of a mortician, approaches an audience with the calm detachment of a psychiatrist, and speaks in the reading-room volume of a librarian.

I realize it was only about a week ago that Biden’s campaign seemed grievously wounded, and he has still won only a single primary. [SEP] TITLE=> The Worm Has Turned in the Democratic Race. ARTICLE=> The establishment has consolidated incredibly rapidly around Joe Biden after his South Carolina triumph. Most importantly, Amy Klobuchar and Peter Buttigieg have both dropped out and are endorsing him.

Touchstone events, such as New York’s parade, were wisely postponed for the first time since 1762. March 17 is a bigger deal in America than in Ireland. There was no doubt whom the Irish were back home: known and persecuted for their Catholic faith, Celtic ethnicity, Gaelic language (spoken out “beyond the Pale”), and rebel tendencies. In the United States, it’s different. [SEP] TITLE=> To show love for the Irish on St. Patrick's Day, give them green cards instead of green beer.

Sanders is well positioned to compete on that broader electoral map, with an army of small-dollar donors to fund his campaign.

[SEP] TITLE=> Federal Court Throws Out Ohio's Congressional Map. ARTICLE=> A federal court has ruled that Ohio's congressional map is an "unconstitutional partisan gerrymander" and must be redrawn by the 2020 election.

TITLE=> Feminists Who Now Claim They Never Meant 'Believe All Women' Are Gaslighting Us. ARTICLE=> The emergence of Tara Reade's accusation of sexual assault against presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden has prompted the swift and sudden collapse of the #MeToo movement's central tenet—that all women who come forward with such allegations deserve to be believed.

ARTICLE=> The United States is now in what disaster-preparedness experts once modeled as a worst-case scenario. We are flooded with a highly transmissible virus that causes unpredictable symptoms: sometimes mild, sometimes fatal. The curve is not flat, or even a curve.

In this precarious moment, many Americans are planning to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by traveling and having dinner with 10 or more people.

The president urged Americans to be unified in battling the coronavirus and to continue to take precautions against its spread while the administration works to make vaccines more widely available. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden leaves Trump's dystopia in the dust. ARTICLE=> If you were expecting President Joe Biden to take a victory lap, to boast about his remarkable achievements in just 50 days in office, it's understandable. After four years of the former president, many of us became accustomed to self-serving rhetoric. But Biden's first prime-time address Thursday night was something altogether different from that. "I need you," Biden said, leaning into his lectern, "I need every American to do their part."

TITLE=> Biden-GOP Infrastructure Talks Dead.

[SEP] TITLE=> Pence takes Harris to the cleaners in VP debate. ARTICLE=> Vice President Mike Pence emerged from the 2020 vice presidential debate Wednesday night with a sound victory over challenger Sen. Kamala Harris.

Rudy Giuliani sweated so much during a press conference Thursday that streaks of what appeared to be dark hair dye streamed down his cheeks, making for a bizarre juxtaposition as the ex-mayor insisted without evidence that Democrats stole the election from President Trump.

TITLE=> Trump's favorability and perceptions of COVID-19 response stagnate post-convention: POLL. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump's efforts to build his appeal and define his opponent at the Republican National Convention, using pageantry and the White House as the backdrop, had little apparent impact on the electorate's impressions of both him and former Vice President Joe Biden, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds. Trump's week of celebration did not improve his favorability, even among his own base, and the country still remains widely critical of his handling of the major crisis of his presidency: COVID-19. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump’s popularity slips in latest Military Times poll — and more troops say they’ll vote for Biden. ARTICLE=> The latest Military Times poll shows a continued decline in active-duty service members’ views of President Donald Trump and a slight but significant preference for former Vice President Joe Biden in the upcoming November election among troops surveyed.

TITLE=> Trump cannot block grand jury subpoena for his tax returns, court rules. ARTICLE=> A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that President Trump cannot block enforcement of a New York grand jury subpoena for eight years of his tax returns. The ruling, from a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, affirms a federal judge's decision in August that rejected Trump's claims that the subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. (D) was overly broad and issued in bad faith.

[SEP] TITLE=> The 9/11 Generation Comes of Age. ARTICLE=> It’s always difficult to determine precisely when an epochal event makes the transition from memory to history, but 2019 may well mark that moment for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. This week’s 18th anniversary can be seen as both the legal coming-of-age of the cohort born in the wake of al Qaeda’s assault and the generational passing of the torch from the children of the Cold War to the children of the war on terror. [SEP] TITLE=> A letter to 9/11: Happy birthday to the war without end. ARTICLE=> The day you entered this world I woke to the news on my radio alarm clock. I listened, horror-struck, on my drive to school, then watched your carnage on the TVs in my high school auditorium.

ARTICLE=> The Strategic National Stockpile, a once little-known resource, has turned into a political tug-of-war as states scramble for gowns, masks, ventilators and other equipment during the coronavirus pandemic.

ARTICLE=> The Obama administration sought several cuts in funding for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other critical medical supplies -- although some of the reductions were relatively small, and most came after Republicans implemented a new law to restrict federal discretionary spending, records reviewed by Fox News show. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign has recently stepped up its attacks on President Trump's pandemic preparedness, drawing what could be one of the most consequential battle lines of the presidential race amid the coronavirus crisis.
TITLE=> Who Will Win The Third Democratic Debate?. ARTICLE=> It’s time for the third Democratic debate! And a lot has changed since the first debate in June. Back then, there was only one clear polling front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, and the size of the field was daunting, with more than 20 “major” candidates.

And that’s been pretty consistent for several months now. [SEP] TITLE=> Majority of Democratic voters give thumbs down to crowded presidential debate stage. ARTICLE=> Democratic presidential hopefuls will once again crowd on stage at their third debate, set to air on ABC News on Thursday. Ten candidates will be on hand to have their say.

TITLE=> Senate now lacks votes to abolish parts of ACA outright. ARTICLE=> It became apparent today that GOP leaders, who were caught off guard by defections of their members Monday night, lacked the votes to abolish parts of the 2010 law outright. Three centrist Republican senators — Susan Collins (Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — all said they would oppose any vote to proceed with an immediate repeal of the law. [SEP] TITLE=> Dead on Arrival: 'Repeal Now, Replace Later' Has Already Crashed. ARTICLE=> When I wrote this analysis earlier, 'Plan B' was already on life support. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Shelley Moore Capito had signaled that they were no-go's on the GOP backup proposal, which would entail passing the same "clean" repeal bill approved by the upper chamber in late 2015. That was a show vote, I explained, and everybody knew it. [SEP] TITLE=> McConnell Backup Plan To Repeal Affordable Care Act Falters.

ARTICLE=> On Friday, President Trump unrolled what he refers to as a “platinum plan” for Black America, calling for increased investment in Black businesses and additional capital for Black entrepreneurs. The President also announced support for Juneteenth to be recognized as a national holiday. But is Trump’s plan to little and too late to convince Black voters to support him?

[SEP] TITLE=> Trump Tells Black Voters That Democrats Take Them for Granted.

TITLE=> CBC edit of Trump scene from Home Alone 2 was done in 2014. ARTICLE=> CBC confirmed Thursday it deleted a scene featuring Donald Trump from the movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, but the broadcaster says the cut occurred before he became president and was not politically motivated.

During Thursday’s broadcast of Fox & Friends, Pavlich took issue with the CBC axing Trump’s seven-second scene from their airings. After fellow co-host Ed Henry called it “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Pavlich groused that it was “also censorship.”
TITLE=> How identity politics blew up in Democrats' faces. ARTICLE=> What's the matter with America? That seems to be the burning question on the tongues of many liberals in the wake of Donald Trump's stunning upset victory over Hillary Clinton. And in a way, that question is a mash-up response to two popular theories on America's political landscape, the first laid out in Thomas Frank's What's the Matter with Kansas?, and the second in The Emerging Democratic Majority by John Judis and Ruy Teixera. [SEP] TITLE=> The End of Identity Liberalism. ARTICLE=> It is a truism that America has become a more diverse country. It is also a beautiful thing to watch. Visitors from other countries, particularly those having trouble incorporating different ethnic groups and faiths, are amazed that we manage to pull it off. Not perfectly, of course, but certainly better than any European or Asian nation today. It’s an extraordinary success story. But how should this diversity shape our politics?

They assumed African-Americans would vote along straight Democratic lines, but a surprising number left the top line of the ballot blank.

ARTICLE=> Mike Pence has promoted an unsubstantiated theory linking the 9/11 terrorist attacks to Iran in his defence of the Trump administration’s assassination of Qassem Soleimani. Donald Trump’s vice president posted a Twitter thread on Saturday in which he described Iran’s top military commander as “an evil man responsible for killing thousands of Americans”. In the thread, Mr Pence claimed Soleimani had “assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States”. [SEP] TITLE=> Reality check: Mike Pence links Soleimani to 9/11. ARTICLE=> While defending President Trump's decision to authorize the drone strike that killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, Vice President Pence claimed on Twitter that Soleimani helped "10 of the 12" Sept. 11 attackers travel to Afghanistan. Reality check: "That does not match established historical accounts of General Suleimani or public United States intelligence about the hijackers," The New York Times writes. [SEP] TITLE=> Iran proved vital to al Qaeda's safe passage, according to bin Laden records, 9/11 commission. ARTICLE=> Iran “facilitated” the movement of al Qaeda terrorists through its country, including September 11, 2001 attackers and for years was a critical channel for money and arms, according to the 9-11 commission report and internal Osama bin Laden documents. Experts say the late Qassem Soleimani surely knew of and directed the terror partnership since he has headed since 1998 Iran’s Quds Force. It is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization and an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps which dominates Iranian society.
TITLE=> Biden immigration plan speeds legalization, lags on border security. ARTICLE=> President Biden‘s immigration bill cancels penalties for future illegal immigrants, speeds legalization of those already here and increases legal immigration levels. But the bill, which lawmakers will officially introduce on Capitol Hill on Thursday, backtracks on new border security and worksite enforcement compromises that have long been seen as key parts of any serious attempt to overhaul the immigration system. A senior administration official acknowledged that was intentional. “This is not a bipartisan bill,” the official told reporters in previewing the legislation.

Long awaited control of the White House and both houses of Congress. A chance to deliver on an every two-year election cycle promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

[SEP] TITLE=> White House Tailors Health-Law Tweaks for Conservative Appeal. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration is floating a new health-care proposal aimed at winning over House conservatives that could allow states to opt-out of some requirements in the Affordable Care Act.

TITLE=> Speed of Taliban Advance Surprises Biden Administration, Dismays U.S. Allies. ARTICLE=> When President Biden this spring announced the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, his administration expected the Afghan military to defend key cities and perhaps battle the Taliban to a stalemate. Before the current Taliban offensive, U.S. officials said they didn’t expect the takeover of any provincial capital until fall at the earliest. Instead, a carefully planned strategy carried out by the Taliban has produced swift battlefield advances, allowing insurgents to seize a succession of provincial capitals since Friday. [SEP] TITLE=> Could the Taliban Take Over Afghanistan? Here’s What We Know.. ARTICLE=> Since international troops began withdrawing from Afghanistan in May, the Taliban have carried out a sweeping military campaign and gained control of much of the country’s rural areas. But for months, the insurgents failed to capture major cities — until now. Over the past six days, the insurgents have overrun nine provincial capitals across the country, most of them clustered in the north, in a major escalation of their military offensive and a devastating setback for the Afghan government. [SEP] TITLE=> Afghanistan capital Kabul could fall to Taliban within 90 days, US assesses. ARTICLE=> The U.S. assesses that the capital of Afghanistan could fall to the Taliban within the next 90 days, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Fox News, just weeks before President Biden plans to completely withdraw U.S. troops from the region following nearly two decades of war. The Taliban seized three more Afghan provincial capitals and a local army headquarters on Wednesday, attaining control of two-thirds of the nation. The sources said that the intelligence regarding Kabul’s security has been dire for some time.
TITLE=> What the polls show, and the press missed, again. ARTICLE=> THE FINAL VOTE TALLIES still aren’t known, but the media verdict of this presidential election is in: it’s 2016 all over again. Four years ago, in the hours after Donald Trump declared victory on the strength of 306 Electoral College votes and the ballots of nearly sixty-three million Americans, I wrote a column about the failures of the press throughout that campaign, and declared that “journalism’s moment of reckoning” had arrived. [SEP] TITLE=> The Media Need to Reflect on This Election Result. ARTICLE=> The media convinced themselves that their foamy-mouthed anger with Donald J. Trump was shared by the American people as a whole. The people responded with a giant nuh-uh. President Trump will not go in the books as a Jimmy Carter or even as a George H.W. Bush: Despite his having presided over perhaps the bleakest American year in my lifetime, his reelection was an attractive proposition for a massive slice of voters. [SEP] TITLE=> The Polling Crisis Is a Catastrophe for American Democracy. ARTICLE=> Even with the results of the presidential contest still out, there’s a clear loser in this election: polling. Surveys badly missed the results, predicting an easy win for former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic pickup in the Senate, and gains for the party in the House. Instead, the presidential election is still too close to call, Republicans seem poised to hold the Senate, and the Democratic edge in the House is likely to shrink.

TITLE=> The Taliban are sitting on $1 trillion worth of minerals the world desperately needs. ARTICLE=> The swift fall of Afghanistan to Taliban fighters two decades after the United States invaded the country has triggered a political and humanitarian crisis. It’s also causing security experts to wonder: What’s going to happen to the country’s vast untapped mineral wealth? Afghanistan is one of the poorest nations in the world. But in 2010, US military officials and geologists revealed that the country, which lies at the crossroads of Central and South Asia, was sitting on mineral deposits worth nearly $1 trillion that could dramatically transform its economic prospects. [SEP] TITLE=> China outflanking US in the wake of Biden’s Afghan debacle. ARTICLE=> Great-power competition is back — just when America happens to be an overstretched, and now-humiliated, empire. Events in the wake of President Joe Biden’s botched exit from Afghanistan punctuate the point. China wasted little time seizing on the debacle to make geopolitical inroads and assert a growing hegemony in the Asia-Pacific. The Beijing regime moved to develop relations with the new Taliban regime in Kabul and held assault exercises near Taiwan island on Tuesday. [SEP] TITLE=> 4 Reasons A Taliban Takeover In Afghanistan Matters To The World. ARTICLE=> Helicopters evacuating Americans from Kabul as the Taliban closed in was a scene likened to the 1975 fall of Saigon in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. Afghanistan's U.S.-trained forces appeared to readily collapse in the face of a concerted push by Taliban forces. Names and places that became familiar to Americans during their country's long involvement there — including Kunduz and Kandahar — fell like dominoes in recent days as the Taliban swept toward the capital.

[SEP] TITLE=> High sign for legal pot — Pritzker inks bill making Illinois 11th state to allow recreational reefer. ARTICLE=> Recreational marijuana is now roughly six months away from being legal across Illinois. Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the bill into law Tuesday.

In Vermont and Washington, D.C., cannabis possession and cultivation is legal but sales are not regulated. Illinois and Vermont both legalized the drug through the legislative process, and not via a ballot initiative.

ARTICLE=> The Department of Homeland Security said it would increase the fee to apply for U.S. citizenship by 81% to $1,160 and impose a fee for the first time to apply for asylum, according to a filing in the Federal Register on Friday. The fee increases, proposed last year, come as the government agency that handles applications faces a budget shortfall and are the latest in a string of rule changes making it tougher for low-income people to immigrate legally or become U.S. citizens. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump administration to increase immigration fees, impose fee for asylum claims. ARTICLE=> The Trump administration announced Friday that it is increasing immigration fees -- with those seeking citizenship facing a hike of more than 80 percent, while asylum seekers will face a charge for their claim.

TITLE=> Elizabeth Warren proved conclusively you can't get elected on identity politics. ARTICLE=> Things are moving fast in American politics, but see if you can remember back five months to last fall. At the time, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the most likely Democratic nominee. She had big leads in both Iowa and New Hampshire. She had overtaken establishment designated front-runner, Joe Biden, in the national polling. [SEP] TITLE=> Why women are feeling so defeated after Elizabeth Warren’s loss. ARTICLE=> Many women are left feeling defeated after Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the presidential race. With a crushing loss on Super Tuesday, and voter after voter quoted in the media saying they’d vote for a woman, just not Warren, it made some wonder if a woman would be president in their lifetimes. Warren spoke about the bind women candidates face while talking with reporters Thursday afternoon. [SEP] TITLE=> Gender questions swirl as Warren leaves race to two old men. ARTICLE=> Now that Elizabeth Warren has bowed to the inevitable, the Biden-Bernie matchup is either a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party…or the typical dust-settling of a conventional race. That is, one establishment candidate, a veteran, battle-scarred establishment type who is not terribly exciting, and an insurgent candidate, a colorful, more ideological provocateur who makes followers swoon. In this view, the voters who gave Joe Biden 10 Super Tuesday victories were simply coming home after flirting with two dozen potential dates.

TITLE=> CNN Implicitly Took Elizabeth Warren's Side in the Unproven Sexism Accusation Against Bernie Sanders. ARTICLE=> Diehard supports of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) have long believed that the mainstream media finds subtle ways to undermine their candidate—and occasionally their suspicions are well supported. Tuesday night's Democratic debate provided another one of these moments, as the progressive believe-all-victims mantra led CNN's Abby Phillip to presume the truth of the unproven accusation that Sanders privately told Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) that a woman couldn't win the presidency. [SEP] TITLE=> At the Iowa Debate, Bernie Sanders' Most Vociferous Opponent Was CNN. ARTICLE=> AHEAD OF THE August 2015 Fox News debate, the company’s chair, Rupert Murdoch, issued a directive to debate moderator Megyn Kelly: The Donald Trump thing has gone on long enough, it’s time to take him down.

ARTICLE=> Sally Yates, who served as Deputy Attorney General during a critical period as the Russia collusion hoax evolved in 2016-17, trashed fired FBI director James Comey during her testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She readily agreed that Comey went “rogue” in his unauthorized pursuit of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But that, of course, was stating the obvious. It was too easy. Comey managed to turn himself into a human piñata when he engaged in blatant acts of corruption. [SEP] TITLE=> Sally Yates, Under Attack by Republicans, Defends Flynn Investigation.

TITLE=> I opposed taking Woodrow Wilson’s name off our school. Here’s why I changed my mind.. ARTICLE=> The Princeton University Board of Trustees voted on Friday to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from the university’s School of Public and International Affairs. It acted because Wilson’s racist opinions and policies make him an inappropriate namesake for a school whose scholars, students and alumni must stand firmly against racism and for equality and justice. For my university, the decision was momentous. Wilson was an undergraduate alumnus of Princeton, a distinguished professor on its faculty and eventually its 13th president. [SEP] TITLE=> What This Moment of Reckoning About Woodrow Wilson’s Racism Leaves Out. ARTICLE=> In 1919, the pioneering newspaper editor and civil rights activist Monroe Trotter obtained papers to work as a cook on a ship sailing from the United States to France. After the ship docked, he learned that crew members were not permitted to disembark, so he sneaked off and arrived in Paris “ragged and hungry and in need of funds,” he would write later. This was not his first choice as a mode of transportation. [SEP] TITLE=> Don’t Cheer Woodrow Wilson’s Cancellation. ARTICLE=> First things first: Woodrow Wilson was a deplorable bigot and one of the worst presidents in American history. He re-segregated the federal government, glamorized the Ku Klux Klan, screened The Birth of a Nation at the White House, and opposed Reconstruction and black suffrage (Dylan Matthews has more on Wilson’s racism). In common with many progressive intellectuals of his time, he was a champion of eugenics. He sank the United States into the pointless carnage of World War I.

The events of 2020, however significant, had an effect on everyone. NPR's Morning Edition wanted to know what helped get people through the tough times — and hundreds responded on Twitter. Some said they turned to writing letters, creating art or starting a new hobby. Others relied on friends and family and mindless escapist TV shows. [SEP] TITLE=> 18 Actually Good Things That Happened in 2020. ARTICLE=> In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surprising amount of positive news to celebrate this past year. Let’s start with the obvious: 2020 was a massively disappointing year, right from the jump.

It can be broad and diverse, created from all kinds of information sources. But there is still a bubble. Which is why opinion pages and books matter so much. They serve to expand the bubble. Columns can nudge us toward new ideas and broader perspectives, but it is a book that punches out the bubble and really expands the mind.

TITLE=> House approves bills tightening background checks on guns. ARTICLE=> The House on Thursday approved two pieces of legislation aimed at strengthening background checks on firearm sales and transfers, a leading priority for Democratic lawmakers. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act — spearheaded by Rep.

TITLE=> Dave Chappelle vs. trans people vs. Netflix. ARTICLE=> For the past several years, comedian Dave Chappelle has been locked in a vicious cycle of anti-cancel-culture standup comedy. Over six Netflix specials, Chappelle has lashed out at what he views as progressive attempts to cancel him for his incendiary comedy — all while mocking the queer and transgender communities and the Me Too movement and generally doubling, tripling, and sextupling down on the offensive jokes and reactionary politics that people took issue with in the first place. It’s a fatiguing ouroboros. [SEP] TITLE=> Defending Dave Chappelle. ARTICLE=> Asked whether men can give birth, most people wouldn’t respond the way the transgenderism-obsessed Left would prefer. Understanding this, the Left is trying to hector, bully, and censor its way toward establishing a ridiculous new conception of gender as a matter of personal choosing rather than biological fact. That project requires changing the language, ignoring science, and discarding common human experience. Now, it appears to require policing comedy, too.

ARTICLE=> Pharmaceutical giant Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced Monday that it has asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency approval of its COVID-19 pill after the experimental drug showed “compelling results” in clinical trials.

TITLE=> Year-end session leaves bigger COVID-19 checks in Senate limbo. ARTICLE=> Increased stimulus checks remain in limbo in the Senate, where lawmakers are gathering Wednesday to begin the process of overriding President Trump’s veto of a critical defense bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked quick consideration of a House-passed bill to boost a new round of checks from $600 to $2,000 per individual. [SEP] TITLE=> There is no sign that a bill on $2,000 checks is going to get a vote in the Senate. ARTICLE=> Things are going to drag on in the Senate for a few days. Bottom line: There is absolutely no sign right now that a standalone bill on $2,000 checks is going to get a vote on the Senate floor. It looks like McConnell is simply going to run out the clock. There were several opportunities on Tuesday when McConnell could have made that assurance or let Democrats pass the bill with a unanimous consent agreement that would have shielded his members from having to take a potentially tough vote. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump’s $2,000 checks stall in Senate as GOP blocks vote. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump’s push for bigger $2,000 COVID-19 relief checks stalled out in the Senate as Republicans blocked a swift vote proposed by Democrats and split within their own ranks over whether to boost spending or defy the White House. The roadblock mounted Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may not be sustainable as pressure mounts. Trump wants the Republican-led chamber to follow the House and increase the checks from $600 for millions of Americans.

THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, responsible for users' "high" sensation.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday its consumer price index increased 0.6% last month, the biggest gain since August 2012, after easing 0.1% in May.

TITLE=> Brexit Is Finally Done, but It Already Seems Out of Date. ARTICLE=> LONDON — It took 11 grueling months for negotiators from Britain and the European Union to hammer out the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal. But in many respects, the deal is already four and a half years out of date.

[SEP] TITLE=> Prosperity After Brexit. ARTICLE=> Brexit came down to the wire but it arrived Thursday, with a new trade deal between the United Kingdom and European Union. Arguments about whether this is a good or bad deal for either side matter less than the fact that British voters have finally received what they voted for in 2016.

[SEP] TITLE=> What Comes Next For The Approved Brexit Trade Deal?. ARTICLE=> Lawmakers in Britain and the European Union have finally found common ground for a post-Brexit trade deal. While that clears a major hurdle, the proposed deal still has a long way to go before it’s fully approved by all parties.

The late agreement technically can’t be ratified by the European parliament before the Dec. 31 deadline, which is when the transition period ends.

[SEP] TITLE=> What the Whitest Democratic Debate Stage Had to Say About Race. ARTICLE=> Race was always going to be a topic in Thursday night’s Democratic debate, if only by omission. California Sen. Kamala Harris had already dropped out of the race, and under the more restrictive qualifying rules for this round, the low-polling but game Julián Castro and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker were left out—as was Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, though she said she would have refused to attend anyway. Only the last-minute qualification of Andrew Yang spared the party from presenting an all-white stage. [SEP] TITLE=> 6 Takeaways From The 6th Democratic Debate.

But the political focus shifted to the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for their sixth debate, this one in Los Angeles and hosted by the PBS NewsHour and Politico.

ARTICLE=> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was dead-set against giving unrestricted funds to states and local governments in the covid-19 relief bill the Senate passed Tuesday. Instead, he wants states to be able to declare bankruptcy, which would mean pension plans, government contractors, union workers and a whole slew of other stakeholders would suffer. He blithely declares, after spending trillions of dollars on everything from airline bailouts to small-business loans to enhanced employment that we shouldn’t borrow to fund state and local governments. [SEP] TITLE=> Mitch McConnell gets bipartisan blowback for pushing bankruptcy over federal aid for reeling states.

[SEP] TITLE=> On impeachment, the stakes are high not only for Trump but also for almost everybody else.

Trump, accustomed to earning the word "unprecedented" while he was in office over the past four years, will do it again out of office – the first president to be impeached twice, and the first to face that historic rebuke even after he had moved out of the White House. That's not the sort of distinction presidents typically aspire to have.

It's in the world of work that these questions could have the greatest impact. [SEP] TITLE=> Time to choose new way forward, activist Thunberg says on Earth Day.

[SEP] TITLE=> Do charges against Jeffrey Epstein signal 'bigger targets'?.

And he is still the front-runner, until someone can prove otherwise. [SEP] TITLE=> Biden Survives, So Biden Wins.

TITLE=> Hunter Biden's China adventure is a problem for Joe Biden. ARTICLE=> President Trump's phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is deeply problematic. But Joe Biden's decision to allow his son, Hunter, to travel with him on a 2013 trip to China is a problem for the former vice president.

ARTICLE=> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Thursday that President Donald Trump’s request for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden constitutes “a fundamental breach of the president’s oath of office.” “To have a president of the United States suggesting, urging a foreign country to interfere in our presidential elections is an illustration that if this president has learned anything from the two years of [former special counsel Robert Mueller’s] investigation, it’s that he feels he can do anything with impunity,” Schiff told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The White House now says the president was not specifically urging North Carolina voters to break election law. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump’s awful advice on voting twice. ARTICLE=> President Trump caused a stir Wednesday by advising his supporters in North Carolina to attempt to vote twice. This would be, if completed and done intentionally, illegal. What’s more, North Carolina state law also makes it a Class I felony “to induce” someone to do this. The pushback from Trump’s allies is familiar: He was joking. And that’s plausible! It’s entirely possible Trump was speaking somewhat in jest to make a point about the supposed lack of security in mail-in voting, which he has routinely attacked in hyperbolic ways.

ARTICLE=> The vice president of the United States officially accepted the nomination to continue being the vice president. He did so in a controversial and scathing speech toward the Democrats.

[SEP] TITLE=> Will Political Winds Favor the Libertarians?. ARTICLE=> The one common thread is this presidential election is how much voters dislike the presumptive candidates of our political duopoly. The reality is — voters want more choices. Sadly, one area where Republicans and Democrats are most willing to cooperate is stopping third party efforts with rules and regulations meant to protect the duopoly. One such reform in California now means many areas are effectively one-party states. For instance, my choice for Congress was limited to Republican A or Republican B. No other option allowed. [SEP] TITLE=> Spotlight on Libertarian convention amid voter unease over Trump-Clinton race.

ARTICLE=> Joe Biden scored decisive primary victories in Michigan and three other U.S. states on Tuesday, taking a big step toward the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination and casting doubt on the future of rival Bernie Sanders’ fading White House bid. The sweeping wins put Biden, 77, on a path to face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, and the former vice president quickly began to look ahead, calling for party unity and making an appeal to supporters of Sanders. [SEP] TITLE=> Bye-bye, Bernie. ARTICLE=> Four years ago, Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled off an upset in Michigan that gave life to his insurgent challenge to front-runner Hillary Clinton. On Tuesday, Sanders suffered a crushing defeat in the state, and whether he’s ready or not to acknowledge it, he is now without a realistic path to the Democratic nomination. It’s incredible to think that just over two weeks ago, Sanders was the heavy favorite to be the Democratic nominee. [SEP] TITLE=> Michigan Romp Shows Biden Could Rebuild Democrats' ‘Blue Wall’ vs. Trump. ARTICLE=> Maybe you’ve never heard of Livingston County, Michigan. It’s not Oakland County, the vote-rich behemoth located next door; nor is it Macomb County, the much-mythologized home of the culturally conservative “Reagan Democrats” who began defecting to the Republican Party decades ago. It’s a lot less populated, and a little too far from Detroit, to attract much notice from journalists and pundits. And yet, as the returns rolled in Tuesday night from Michigan’s primary, it was Livingston that told the most compelling story.

TITLE=> President Trump Is Unfit for This Crisis. Period.. ARTICLE=> The coronavirus is no longer just a slow-moving public health crisis that may soon turn into a rapid-moving one. It’s a crisis of transparency. It’s a crisis of government legitimacy. So it is in this spirit that we all have to say: enough. Whose side is the Trump administration on? Based on every public appearance we’ve seen so far — whether it’s from a cabinet member or the director of the Centers for Disease Control or the president himself — the answer is clear: not the public’s. [SEP] TITLE=> Never mind Trump. Coronavirus shows why electing competent state and local officials is vital.. ARTICLE=> How the president responds to a disease outbreak is important, but it is only one aspect of multifaceted efforts at every level of government. Does a county have a system for prioritizing who receives virus tests and for delivering the results quickly? Will public transit be sanitized?

ARTICLE=> The Delta coronavirus variant doubles the risk of hospitalisation compared with the previously dominant variant in Britain, but two doses of vaccine still provide strong protection, a Scottish study found on Monday.

Although the vaccines reduced the risk of people needing to be admitted to hospital, it could take up to 28 days after the first dose to have sufficient immunity.

ARTICLE=> A new member of the liberal “Squad” stepped to the forefront this week, leading a Capitol steps sit-in that forced the White House to act. Cori Bush arrived in Congress as an heir to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now the political neophyte is coming into her own.

[SEP] TITLE=> The Biden Administration Issues A New Eviction Moratorium After A Federal Ban Lapsed. ARTICLE=> Days after a national eviction moratorium expired, the Biden administration on Tuesday issued a new, more limited freeze that remains in effect through Oct. 3.

TITLE=> Here’s how Trump and Biden stack up in polling in six key battleground states. ARTICLE=> President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are competing for voters in battleground states that will likely sway the November election: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. All those states — some historically favorable for Democrats — voted for Trump in 2016 over then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had voted consistently for Democratic presidential candidates from 1992 to 2012, with Trump being the first Republican to break the streak of blue wins in those states with narrow victories.

TITLE=> Fact-checking the avalanche of Wisconsin election misinformation. ARTICLE=> A razor-thin margin, a slow vote count and a presidential election hanging in the balance have created the perfect storm for misinformation in Wisconsin. The morning after the election, social media generated an avalanche of claims about Wisconsin voting totals, timing and turnout. Much of it isn’t true. We’re separating fact from fiction on some of the most widely shared claims. CLAIM: "There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results." [SEP] TITLE=> Did a Poll Worker in Pennsylvania Throw Away Trump Ballots?. ARTICLE=> A viral tweet, now deleted, and other social media posts claim to show the Instagram story of a poll worker named Sebastian Machado in Erie, Pennsylvania, who admitted to throwing away ballots cast for President Trump.

A false photo caption claimed the photo showed an unidentified civilian removing an official ballot box from a polling location in Philadelphia on Election Day.
TITLE=> Pandemic, politics invade Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. ARTICLE=> Three weeks before America elects a president amid a pandemic and with Democrats condemning the process, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday set about advancing a Supreme Court justice who could serve for decades to come. The result appeared preordained as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the committee chairman, said at the outset. But over four days, conservative federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett appears certain to face tough questions in her quest to succeed the late liberal Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [SEP] TITLE=> Democrats don’t dare say why they oppose Judge Barrett, so they lie instead. ARTICLE=> Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee devoted their opening statements on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to repeating a shameless lie. Why can’t they share their real reasons for opposing her? The Democrats, one after another, claimed that confirming Barrett would result in ObamaCare being overturned when the court takes it up Nov. 10, with Americans dying as a result. It’s plainly false: Several conservative justices clearly don’t buy the arguments made for striking down the law in this case.

TITLE=> Senate Democrats can now officially pass more bills with 51 votes. ARTICLE=> Senate Democrats just got some wonky procedural news that has some pretty big implications for President Joe Biden’s agenda. On Monday night, the Senate parliamentarian — an in-house rules expert — determined that Democrats would be able to do a third budget reconciliation bill this year, a massive development that gives lawmakers more room to pass legislation without Republican support. Already, Democrats had the ability to do two budget reconciliation bills: one focused on fiscal year 2021 and one focused on fiscal year 2022. [SEP] TITLE=> Senate Dems Can Bypass GOP Filibuster on Two More Bills, Parliamentarian Rules. ARTICLE=> The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that Democrats can pass two more pieces of legislation via budget reconciliation procedures, bypassing a potential filibuster by Republicans. The ruling allows Democrats to pass two bills with a simple majority instead of the usual 60-vote threshold required in the Senate. Democrats plan to use the budget reconciliation process to approve the Biden administration’s infrastructure plan, which is split into two bills. The process was previously used to pass Democrats’ coronavirus relief bill. [SEP] TITLE=> Ruling By Senate Parliamentarian Opens Up Potential Pathway For Democrats. ARTICLE=> A new decision from the U.S. Senate's nonpartisan parliamentarian means Democrats could advance more of President Biden's agenda without the support of Republicans. The official's interpretation of Senate budget rules would allow the use of the reconciliation process more than once in a fiscal year, and it is viewed by Democrats as a possible strategy for moving top policy priorities with a simple majority, since getting the needed 10 Republican votes in a 50-50 Senate has proved difficult.

Mondale was Jimmy Carter's running mate in 1976, beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford and Bob Dole. Hamstrung by a weakened U.S. economy and energy crisis, Carter and Mondale lost reelection in 1980 to Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

This is welcome news.
