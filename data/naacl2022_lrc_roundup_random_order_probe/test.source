Two men are accused of assaulting Sicknick by spraying a powerful chemical irritant at him during the siege, but prosecutors have not tied that exposure to Sicknick’s death.

[SEP] TITLE=> Michael Bloomberg says his money is why Trump got impeached. ARTICLE=> Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been rising through the Democratic primary race, most likely because of the absolutely massive amount of money he's poured into it.

ARTICLE=> Democrat Jon Ossoff beat Republican David Perdue in one of Georgia’s two Senate runoffs, NBC News projected Wednesday, sealing his party’s control of Congress and the White House.

TITLE=> How the coronavirus could change our politics. ARTICLE=> The coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented in its scope and duration, as has our response to it. The economy stands still while millions of people file for unemployment, our healthcare system is working overtime to prevent an exhaustion of resources, and our lawmakers are struggling to find ways to provide immediate relief while minimizing long-term damage.

TITLE=> Clean energy program likely to be dropped because of Manchin's objections. ARTICLE=> The Clean Energy Performance Program, the linchpin of President Biden’s proposed climate change legislation, is likely to be dropped from the Democrats’ spending bill because of opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., multiple sources have told NBC News. The sources say that the program will most likely be removed from the massive spending package known as the “reconciliation bill” that Democrats plan without Republican support, but that negotiations are ongoing and that no final decision has been made. [SEP] TITLE=> Joe Manchin demands climate provisions stripped from budget bill. ARTICLE=> West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin offered a lump of coal to his fellow Democrats after he demanded $150 billion in clean-energy initiatives be removed from a budget bill currently making its way through the Senate.

ARTICLE=> President Biden had promised to halve U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, but an essential tool the administration planned to use to achieve that goal now appears out of reach.

They were able to cut a deal with Republican lawmakers to avert a government shutdown, but when it comes to passing the rest of President Biden’s agenda, including both an ambitious $3.5 trillion spending plan and a bipartisan infrastructure deal, Democrats have much to sort out. [SEP] TITLE=> The Debt Ceiling Deception. ARTICLE=> Democrats keep telling Americans they have the votes and a mandate to pass the biggest tax increase since 1968 and the biggest domestic spending bill ever. Yet they also claim they’re helpless to raise the federal debt ceiling without Republican votes. It’s a preposterous position, albeit of the sort this Administration often tries to sell. Such as: The soaring number of illegal border crossings in Texas is merely “seasonal,” the Afghanistan withdrawal was a success, and the cost of the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill is “zero.” [SEP] TITLE=> Wonking Out: Biden Should Ignore the Debt Limit and Mint a $1 Trillion Coin.

TITLE=> Why Juneteenth Matters. ARTICLE=> Neither Abraham Lincoln nor the Republican Party freed the slaves. They helped set freedom in motion and eventually codified it into law with the 13th Amendment, but they were not themselves responsible for the end of slavery.

ARTICLE=> Friday marks the 55th anniversary of Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the abolishment of slavery that takes place every year on June 19. The date refers not to the end of legal slavery in the United States but to the gap in time before everyone heard the news. “It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it,” President Trump said of Juneteenth this week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. [SEP] TITLE=> Juneteenth and Modern-Day Slavery. ARTICLE=> Juneteenth should be a reminder to never see any group of humans as non-persons. It never works out well for the ones victimized by such evil arrogance. This holiday commemorates the eventual announcement to slaves in Texas, on June 19th 1865, that President Abraham Lincoln had set them free. The Emancipation Proclamation was issued over two years prior on January 1st, 1863. Isn’t this how truth works sometimes?

[SEP] TITLE=> House to vote on health care ‘Cadillac tax’ repeal. ARTICLE=> The House plans to vote Wednesday on legislation that would roll back the so-called “Cadillac tax” under the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare.

It isn’t set to take effect until 2022, and Congress has twice delayed its implementation. The tax was envisioned as a way to help pay for the 2010 health care law.

TITLE=> In Afghanistan, China Is Ready to Step Into the Void. ARTICLE=> The speed and scope of the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan have prompted introspection in the West over what went wrong, and how, after billions of dollars spent on a 20-year war effort, it could all end so ignominiously. China, though, is looking forward. It is ready to step into the void left by the hasty U.S. retreat to seize a golden opportunity. [SEP] TITLE=> Afghanistan’s fall may trigger other dominoes. ARTICLE=> Small dominoes can eventually topple big nations. The Taliban started tipping dominoes in local provinces and before long had most of Afghanistan under its control. Kabul was merely the last domino to fall. The last domino in Afghanistan that is, certainly not the last around the globe. The aftershocks of the failed U.S. withdrawal will reverberate for some time. If the U.S. should lose its historic mantle of supporting peace through strength, we will have to reckon with the consequences of chaos that results from perceived weakness. [SEP] TITLE=> China both worries and hopes as US departs Afghanistan. ARTICLE=> In the U.S. departure from Afghanistan, China has seen the realization of long-held hopes for a reduction of the influence of a geopolitical rival in what it considers its backyard. Yet, it is also deeply concerned that the very withdrawal could bring risk and instability to that backyard — Central Asia — and possibly even spill over their narrow, remote border into China itself and the heavily Muslim northwestern region of Xinjiang.
TITLE=> Are We Done with China Now?. ARTICLE=> We have known about the People’s Republic of China’s exploitation of American enterprise for years. The problem is that we have not wanted to confront it. Ever since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it has been a relentless and pernicious economic adversary, routinely taking advantage of the greed and weakness of American companies. We should have taken actions previously to address imbalances in our trade relationships, but we didn’t. Now the pandemic has put these issues front and center. [SEP] TITLE=> US-China: Are Americans ready for a (costly) breakup?. ARTICLE=> The Commerce Department announces tighter standards for the export of some sensitive technology to China. Members of Congress send a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo encouraging him to investigate the role of the Chinese Communist Party in what they say was a cover-up of the coronavirus’ origins and a disinformation campaign about the outbreak. [SEP] TITLE=> Trump's anti-China theory implodes. ARTICLE=> The big lie of the Trump administration is that China is the cause of America's problems. The meme has worked for a while, since it plays into American smugness that if China is succeeding, they must be cheating. Trump and his right-wing allies upped this game recently by claiming the Covid-19 pandemic was the result of an accidental release from a Chinese laboratory and that China's "cover up" blocked an effective global response.
TITLE=> Mnuchin warns of ‘permanent economic damage’ unless US reopens. ARTICLE=> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned of “permanent economic damage” unless the United States begins reopening businesses during the coronavirus pandemic — but cautioned that it must be done in a “thoughtful way.” “I think there’s a considerable risk of not reopening, you’re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the American public,” Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We’re going to reopen in a very thoughtful way that gets people back to work safely, that has them social distance,” he continued. [SEP] TITLE=> U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Near 80,000 as States Expand Moves to Reopen. ARTICLE=> As the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic approached 80,000, governors from New York to Ohio to California took steps toward reopening businesses as the economic wreckage from lockdowns climbed. Deaths in the U.S. reached 79,894, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. World-wide, more than 284,000 people have perished from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The numbers may undercount the true death toll, researchers say. Senior White House officials urged governors to move toward restarting commerce as signs of the economic harm rose. [SEP] TITLE=> As States Rush to Reopen, Scientists Fear a Coronavirus Comeback. ARTICLE=> Millions of working people and small-business owners who cannot earn money while sheltering at home are facing economic ruin. So dozens of states, seeking to ease the pain, are coming out of lockdown. Most have not met even minimal criteria for doing so safely, and some are reopening even as coronavirus cases rise, inviting disaster. The much-feared “second wave” of infection may not wait until fall, many scientists say, and instead may become a storm of wavelets breaking unpredictably across the country. The reopenings will proceed nonetheless.
TITLE=> Mapped: Afghan refugees headed to 46 states. ARTICLE=> The Biden administration notified governors and mayors on Wednesday of the number of Afghan evacuees their state is expected to receive in the coming weeks, two senior administration officials told Axios.
