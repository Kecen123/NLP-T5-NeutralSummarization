This is a final project for CSCI-UA.0480 Special Topics: Natural Language Processing.

Abstract: Media framing bias, the problem that occurs as a result of skewed selective writing by journalists, might lead to deepened division between people and undermine social solidarity. Based on previous works, we suggest that automatic neutral summarization could help describe media news in a relatively neutral manner. In this article, we present a new model that uses text-summarization pairs to fine-tune the pre-trained T5 Model. Our model can maintain the salient information while achieving better results in framing bias metrics compared with baseline models.
